Fine. UBI level controlled by the Fed which means total final consumption is largely controlled by the Fed.

&gt; I also think that there should be a law which would require employers to pay for a certain percentage of the schooling/retraining of workers laid off in favor of automation, say 25-100%, depending on the amount of time the employee has been with the company.

Stupid. With a UBI in place the employee should be able to gather additional social assistance or finance to enable self-retraining. Better signaling is required to guide them toward beneficial retraining measures and/or entrepreneurship.",t3_34dwo6,cqujfuf,t1_cqu4zm3,t1_cqujfuf

worldnews,1,0,1,"Disclaimer: I believe we should treat life as starting at birth. I disagree with the following argument. But I'm also a philosophy minor who studied this with an academic who had a big fuss made over the topic a few years ago, so I don't mind the discussion.

There is an argument that life, or personhood, starts after birth. It looks at the properties of a child in womb and newly born, and says they are identical in terms of personhood.

My bioethics tutor, Alberto Giubilini, co-wrote a published article about this, how post birth abortion is morally the same as pre birth abortion. The article is here: http://jme.bmj.com/content/early/2012/03/01/medethics-2011-100411.full

I'm not sure it the article is readily available to the public, but you can Google the authors' names to get a summary. It caused a lot of fuss because, well... Abortion is a sensitive subject, and academic hypothetical discussions of morality don't translate well to real life decision making very  well.

Note he's not advocating it...  He's just saying with certain arguments for pre birth abortion, the logical extension is life or personhood beginning after birth.",t3_34g3iz,cqunkut,t1_cqull4z,t1_cqunkut

Art,1,0,1,"The Essentials of Workstation and Office Cubicles

Choosing the right office cubicle furniture for a business of any size is vital to creating an effective business. Before shopping for office furniture there are a few things you should know first: the budget for office furniture, the measurements and layout of the space, which employees are using the work space, and what type of work the employees are doing within their work space. Once you know these things you can effectively select the right office furniture for your office furniture needs.

Types of Workstations

Benching/Open Plan

Benching/Open Plan is the best design for collaboration between employees. Benching/Open Plan has minimal or no walls/panels separating employees. This space is best for employees who require a high level of collaboration between each other to fulfill their duties.

Office Cubical - Open Plan

Workstation System

The Traditional workstation system is the best design for productivity and privacy. The wall between each cubicle blocks sounds and distractions. Some has argued that traditional cubicle yields the maximum productivity.

BTW I'm not advocating Eevee evolutions in general, just Vaporeon, I don't have a whole lot of experience with Jolteon especially considering I've only seen one once in ORAS OU so far, who lasted as long as me switching ScarfChomp in on a Bolt, and him staying in to trying (I assume) to HP Ice and eating an Earthquake instead.

I do remember in D/P however, he was very viable and was very OU, you could gain so much tempo by predicting a lead you could threaten (often Gyara back then), putting up a very safe Substitute, and then Baton Passing a free sub to whoever you want to fight their response with. Practically nothing is outspeeding 130 base Speed. I don't know the meta in the lower tiers, so assuming you can pull something similar off, I'd say this is the best use for Jolteon, bringing him in off a free switch to replicate this effect wherever possible through out the match. Keep in mind he is paper thin however, and the only way he can really enter the battlefield is either through lead, revenge, Volt Absorb, or a slow Turn/Pass. But once he's out his speed stat and decent SpAtk would let him threaten anything low health, or anything that his STAB super effective's on, and the Substitute is really safe at 130 base stat.

finance,11,0,11,"Wrong answer:  Take a course on them.  Yes, that will teach you the basics, and you will have absolutely no idea how to use those basics to accomplish useful tasks.

For VBA, I'd suggest you Google for some examples that do something you want to try, then learn what every single line of it does, then try tweaking it to do something similar.  And once you've mastered VBA, for the love of Zeus, learn when you can accomplish the same thing with Excel formulas rather than resorting to VBA.  When you need it, you need it; but it makes for *ugly*, unmaintainable solutions.

Unfortunately, for SQL, the ""right"" answer requires you to have access to both a system containing vaguely live data, and someone who has already mastered SQL.  You can work through various Northwind examples with MS' toy DB to get the basic syntax down, but until you see the horror of *real world* data, you won't appreciate 99% of the subtleties of the language.  And, you need access to someone already proficient in SQL because they will save you literally hundreds of hours of learning the ""wrong"" way to do things - For example, I can proudly say that I have *never* used a cursor in production code, and can count the times I've needed to resort to a WHILE loop on one hand - Though my mentor gets more credit for those than I do.  Without access to someone to steer you right, those will mean absolutely nothing to you until you until you try to run your code that performs perfectly well on a few thousand rows, on a few million (or even billion) rows.

That said, neither VBA or SQL count as particularly hard to learn - Just hard to write *well*.",t3_34ild5,cquzuac,t3_34ild5,t1_cquzuac

In the Wizards - Raptors series, the Raptors starters were also horribly off shooting-wise which I think might exaggerate how good the Wiz exactly are right now. I'm also a little uncertain about how consistent their offense can be.

However, all the momentum is behind the Wiz right now and it is definitely arguable that they have a good shot to take the series.

The surgeon also has to massage the uterus for a while to promote shrinkage and prevent haemorrhages, so she massaged the wound very hard for 5 seconds too.

cscareerquestions,1,0,1,"My experience was a bit different...

For example I was asked a question in the vein of: generate some expressions recursively based on the expressions generated in the previous step. After analyzing a problem, I came up with an solution on my own. It wasn't perfect, because it generated a lot of duplicates, which had to be filtered out. So the next step was to find a solution that did not generate the duplicates. I spent a good 10 minutes on this, brainstorming different ideas, approaches, until my interviewer gave me a hint at the end. I did not have time to code the solution, but I understood it immediately and explained him, how I would implement it. I was probably penalized for not coming up with an efficient solution, for not having enough time to code up the efficient solution. My interviewer had no trouble following me, but it did me no good. Now given 1 hour to sit quietly somewhere, I am confident I would have been able to come up with an efficient solution.

This repeated itself with the other interviewers as well. I came up with solutions, but they had issues, but after trying to improve them, I was left with no time to actually code the improved solution. So in my experience so far, I got penalized for not thinking fast enough to come up with an efficient solution. 

None of the problems were especially difficult, the one that caused me the most grief I figured it out immediately after I stepped out. Too little, too late, I guess. Maybe I'm just not sharp enough...",t3_34fqtn,cqv9mm0,t1_cqukc0e,t1_cqv9mm0

Get rid of them if they don't serve you. People, activities, anything. Gone. Just cut them off. If they're not helping you in any way, there's no point letting them into your life. The most fundamental reason people go through life is to find happiness. There's no reason to live with or around people that don't make you happy. Everyone and everything should serve this purpose.

ukpolitics,2,0,2,"So, are you saying that crime does not take place in areas with predominant a white British demography?

Edit: i'm pointing out the selective bias, when people point to crimes committed in certain areas or by certain individuals in order to 'demonstrate' that crime is somehow endemic to certain 'races'/ethnicities/religious/cultural groups, or as a resukt of immigration, multicuralism, diversity, and so on. The implied argument, and logical conclusion, of that thought process is to say that without those 'races'/ethnicities/cultural/religious groups crime wouldn't happen, and therefore immigration/multiculturalism/diversity is the root cause. Rather than just saying that inidividals, and associations of certain individuals, are responsible and should be made accountable for thier own individual actions, and other individuals who happen to share some characteristics of the offenders, are somehow partly to blame. That latter position does not allow the active exploitation of crimes and incidents, which is necessary to feed into the identity politics of 'us v them'. Furthermore, it also highlights the inconsistentlcy, whereby the racial/ethnic/cultural/religion identity of a criminal from one defined group is given prominance, whereas in other cases it is not even considered as a factor.

In Madrid people speak more clearly, but also much faster, and when you ask them to repeat their first response is usually ""Do you know English?"" and I just want to be like...yes but I don't want to speak it right now! 

As far as practicing before you go- download podcasts, read as much as you can in Spanish, talk to people who have studied in the same place as you (more so for general advice than language learning), and obviously continue to speak as much as possible!

BDSMcommunity,7,0,7,"The thing about kitten play and age play and any other identity-focused kink is, what ""works"" tends to be very personal.  What's at play is your self-construction.  What any other person outside your relationship thinks about similar constructions is largely beside the point.  The parameters for making it work don't really have to do with material or safety considerations in the same way (as rope, impact play, or what have you).  Rather, they have to do with your imaginations and your ideas and yourselves.  
  
So for example, for many people (and I and my wife fit this category), kitten play is a purely non-sexual affair, and is more likely to come into play watching TV than engaging in a sex act.  At the same time, some are precisely the opposite, and would keep their kitten identity ""in the bedroom"".  But it's all about how you choose to relate to the idea of being a kitten.  What aspect or portion of yourself you make that.  
  
This is a rare case, incidentally, where I think the relevant FetLife forums are actually worth visiting.  The kitten community is actually quite nice and mutually supportive.  You may get some helpful advice from other kittens there.  ",t3_34oimd,cqwrhmh,t3_34oimd,t1_cqwrhmh

assymetric buildrules are doable though - you just have to follow diffrent buildrules for your object. For example with a ship with three pods, every pod has to be a little biger then its predecessor.

The problems creep in when you try to standardize landing mechanics and behaviour. How to get a assymetric ship to land, so that physics seem coherent? 
With a ten people team, you want to get good results fast, not extraordinary results - never ...

I worked with procedural per piece generation in a open source game- and the irony is that assymetric buildrules are part of the symmetric buildrules- they are just limited to one axis, and when they do appear offset from the middle, they have to appear - you guessed it symmetric.

Here is some giggerish meatsalad, that gets arranged via buildrules..

politics,3,0,3,"&gt;Im not saying it wouldnt make things more streamlined but as a country are we so dedicated to making war streamlined?

Because streamlining things results in less expense. The F-35 is expected to cost approximately 1/3 to 1/4 over it's lifetime what it would to continue to operate the same aircraft.

&gt;And we dont need to truly upgrade from the A10 warthog for guerilla warfare assistance. Since we already have those planes and they work! 

&gt;we already have the most funded, outfitted and trained military in the world, why do we need to keep upping the ante?

To put it short; to win wars faster, demoralise the enemy quicker and have fewer casualties on either side. Look at the invasion of Iraq in 2003; that war was over in 3 weeks with swaths of Iraqi forces giving up in the face of shock and awe tactics and brutal efficiency of the coalition military.

In addition, no military can deploy itself in it's entirety; when the US deployed to defeat Iraq, only a fraction of itself went overseas. So whereas the US may have (eg) 1000 fighters, that may not be much of an advantage over a nation with 300 fighters defending or attacking a neighbouring nation, as you might only be able to deploy 300 fighters yourself. When that happens, you need each one of your fighters to be able to take out several of theirs.

There's also the western world's aversion to blood; while some nations are willing to throw thousands of soldiers into a meatgrinder to accomplish a task (eg North Korea), and ISIS is willing to have every one of it's people die in jihad, the civilian populations of the US and particularly, Europe, Canada and Australia recoil at the death of every soldier.

And so with respect to all of that, that's why the US needs cutting edge air power, especially when Russia and China are developing their own advanced fighters to use and sell to other nations.",t3_34p6x2,cqwtsg5,t1_cqwsf6b,t1_cqwtsg5

---
&gt;
&gt;An __offline retailer__ is a retailer that sell products through a storefront location in-person.
&gt;Unlike online retailers, they generally permit patrons to try on products prior to purchase and may offer professional fitting services. However, offline retailers may not always accept returns, and due to space limitations, their selection of bra sizes may be more limited. Many offline retailers do not carry a full range of bra sizes, and the general clothing they stock may not be well-tailored to the needs of women with large breasts, either. Always call ahead to verify which sizes are in stock.
&gt;Also, not all professional fitters are created equally; while some are very good at their jobs, some are only trying to sell customers bras and scoot them out the door, and use poor, inaccurate bra-fitting technique as a result. Learn how-to tell if a bra fits to develop a point of reference in order to determine if advice is helpful or getting in the way.

The D6 rerolling items into empty pedestals has one, important purpose: you now have to really think on whether you really want to change the item you got or go with it, meaning there are fewer ""100% reroll"" items. I have RPG in rebirth and most of the time, when I'm playing with Isaac, I reroll almost everything that's not a dmg up. Here - ""sister maggy? Hmmm... I guess that IS a dps up, it's better than nothing"". I agree with the Idea, though I think the chance of this happening could be smaller.
2. Eternal champions - I LOVE them. I wish champions in rebirth were this interesting. They all have their own movements and every single eternal enemy is a challenge.

For reference I loaded some Slic3r code for a marvin onto the printer and ran it straight from the SD.  I then flashed the firmware and loaded in that code again.  The banding was minimized and the overall print quality was greatly improved.

For the 1.0 at least (not the 1.0a necessarily) you just have to jump a couple leads on the board, turn it on, then wait a few seconds and remove the leads and restart. From there you can load up the arduino software and get it to recognize the da vinci (some configuration is necessary for that)  and then flash Repetier 0.92.  

The board is difficult to brick since that shorting is basically a hardware factory reset mode, so even if you updated the firmware it wont matter.

You lose none of the functionality of the printer (the firmware retains most of the leveling and cleaning features of the printer) and the quality is just better.",t3_34li0r,cqwysn3,t1_cqw2lmc,t1_cqwysn3

atheism,1,0,1,"&gt;Science CAN disprove creationism once it is defined in a scientific manner (as a testable and falsifiable hypothesis) and within the realm of science.  

&gt;When creationism is defined in a manner which requires special pleading, it no longer becomes science (God showed up 10k yrs ago and did these things which were unique and a 1 time thing and will never happen again) and as such is outside of the realm of scientific discussion.

The thing about creationism is, there's no way to frame it without that special pleading. In the beginning, there was nothing. Then god made everything. No matter what we discover about the origins of life and the universe, it's impossible to rule out god being the thing that made it all happen. No matter what we prove about the age of rocks on our planet or the genesis of distant stars, it will never rule out the existence of an omnipotent being that put the whole thing in motion. 

Intelligent design was the attempt to reframe creationism in a more scientific manner... and it just couldn't do it. It only ended up being another way of looking at evolution. If there's an invisible hand guiding the development of every species on Earth and in the wider universe, there's no way for science as we know it to probe that hand.

Coke paid people to research it and make sure it was safe. They didn't pay them to botch it or lie about it, could you image the backlash on Coke if people found out when it's so easy to? Companies fall to that. Even ones like Coke. They would rather use safe things and pay nerds to make sure they're using the right stuff.

Also, if you had an education, you could read the studies and see that it is peer-reviewed and actually, any college grad could verify it by reading it.

He's right. Only idiots worry about this. Aspartame can cause blindness in very rare cases, with later age. That much I've seen real scientific evidence for.

anime,1,0,1,"I've admittedly been a bit too busy to watch anything past ep. 3 but yeah, I (unfortunately) completely agree with ajthefourth here. Disappointments aside, what if there's also something to be said about the entire Giftia concept as a commentary on our growing consumerism? I think the very existence of near-identical human androids, let alone their use to satisfy our emotional economy while being propagated in a market of supply and demand, might have something to say about our almost wilful growing detachment from our more fundamental social roots as a by-product of our ever-increasing reliance - maybe *embodiment*, even - on technology, information, and interconnectedness. 

I think it's possible that Isla's case might be different *precisely* because she lacks the ingrained personality of her more lively, developed contemporaries. And so it becomes less about how stoic she is or her stoicism itself and more about the nature of her stoicism and how that relates to the Giftia purpose and to us as their creators - about the social and moral implications of Isla's existence outside the sphere of the ""usefulness"" of her personality.

MensRights,1,0,1,"&gt; If we start using somewhat more relevant criteria like able and fit for active military duty, for both men and women, then we're approaching a more equitable foundation for the selection. Maybe somewhere between 10-40% of men, maybe 2-10% of women, depending on what criteria you use and the purpose of the army. Many of the jobs traditionally assigned to the less 'capable' or less physically fit men would be perfectly doable by any woman.

It is very possible that Finnish Defense Forces is cutting corners and counting on the odds. Having a more fine tuned selection process would no doubt benefit the armed forces, but it's not necessarily cost-efficient enough.

The percentage of men going through military service in Finland is high, currently it's around 75%-80%, while the lowest estimates are closer to 60-70%. Making it into 10.40% male - 2-10% female would not satisfy military requirements.

Least capable men, 20-30% of each age group are already exempt from military service, either intermittently or permanently, possibly up to 40% if the lowest estimate of how many men complete military service is correct.

Without a doubt there will be more active discussion in local politics whether women should enter military service because of the trend of declining physical fitness of the male population, or if some other options namely NATO should be seriously considered.

As far as Finland employing nuclear option as a deterrent, that choice is not feasible, or in the hands of Finnish government, but strictly dependent on NATO countries mandate even in the case if Finland would petition to join and would be accepted.

As for making the enemy pay, that is the main function and purpose of our armed forces. If Russia should ever choose to invade Finland, it couldn't be stopped, whether Finland would be a NATO member or not. The proximity to major Russian military bases and St. Petersburg makes this quite problematic. Having as many men as possible going through military training ensures that no matter where the enemy would mobilize their troops, they will be met with resistance with sufficient fighting capabilities.

To this end I would most definitely not mind if women would go through military training or an equivalent training to the same extent as men already do. The monetary requirements for this could be around 2,5 billion € per year on top of the current expenditures, meaning effectively doubling our defense budget. As low as that sum is, it's already an amount that Finnish government does not have.",t3_34qhvx,cqy7w1c,t1_cqy68h5,t1_cqy7w1c

Does it make sense in my case after just opening a Prestige last month? I know it's recommended to wait 91 days but the Delta offer expires May 31st.

3. I pay off my cards a few days before my closing date so my balance is always $0. Does this help my score at all or is it just being anal?

Having read through the Park Code, I can see that neither hammocks or slack-lines are expressly mentioned. 

I actually have been in contact with the Parks and Rec department, and they said their main concerns about slacklines and hammocks are 1. safety and 2. the trees.

It forces the opposition to carry the puck through 3 guys in the neutral zone. If they dump, there's a man low who picks it up and can start the rush before the chase is even there. Yes it's a trap, but it's not the insanely boring left wing lock of the 90s Red Wings or the the Devils' neutral zone trap. And again, Guy doesn't run it all the time.

AskReddit,-1,0,-1,"Build quality is FAR better.  Also, for the increased price, when you do have a problem it is fixed in the Apple store while you wait, and in the worst case scenario is sent off for repair and returned literally in a day or two.  Sometimes they even give you a brand new computer, often upgraded from what you had originally.   The warranty and customer service are top fucking notch.

I recently had my trackpad develop a line of dead pixels on my rMBP.  Took it to the local Apple store, they sent it off for repair down in Texas (I am in Michigan) and it was back by 11am the very next day with not only a new trackpad but a new battery, keyboard, and top case.  I have no clue how they did it (must have been same-day delivery both ways), but it was fucking FAST.  Best part is, they have a tracker that shows where your laptop is, and exactly what is being done to it, so you can essentially check up on it as it goes through the repair process.

Try doing that shit with a plastic PC laptop.  While Apple does have their faults, nothing out there currently comes close to beating them in build quality and 'feel', and I like the OS MUCH better than Windows.  I remember I had to send my last creaky, plastic laptop (a high-end HP) in for a warranty repair, and it literally took three weeks to get it back, and that includes a lot of arguing with their customer service.

As for the specs, they don't mean much when the OS and software is designed for very specific hardware (unlike a PC where the ecosystem is incredibly fragmented).  Everything is optimized for the hardware, and Macs are INCREDIBLY fast.  My windows PC with far greater specs is actually quite a bit slower in real-world use than my rMBP with lesser specs.  From a totally cold boot (not suspend or hibernation) to the time I can actually start using the computer is about 3-4 seconds on my mac, and about 12-13 seconds on my PC.  It all comes down to optimization.  

The other positive I have found is my PC laptop gets about 6-7 hours out of the battery when it was brand new and you had to baby it along to get those times.  My rMBP easily gets 14-15 hours with light use (browsing reddit, etc...), and about 10 with moderate use.  ",t3_34yvgh,cqzxhen,t1_cqzdjt8,t1_cqzxhen

I think that's extremely unfair to Bryan because it just sounds like sour grapes from people who seem to hate Adam Carolla, which seems to be like half of this sub-reddit.

As many have said here, I don't think he exactly agrees with Adam every step of the way, but maybe with some overall principle of the matter. I mean I can't even begin to count how many times Adam will do his blunt point, and Bald will kind of explain the facets of the scenario. He'll often provide a counter-example (whether it's in jest or serious) to a lot of Adam's ramblings.

I mean look at the interview with Michael Jai White yesterday. He kind of did this in a more observable fashion when Adam went on his rant about family and Michael chimed in how just a few generations ago, black people were forced to live without parents, and they seem to be getting better every generation. I think Bald Bryan kind of has the same effect with Adam, whereas Adam will go on a rant, putting things in binary, but Bryan is there to kind of show it's analog. Like he doesn't have to blatantly disagree with Adam to not agree with Adam, if that makes any sense.

anarchyonline,1,0,1,"The good news: atrox can do great in any of those professions!

Trader and NT are heavy casting classes, and you might think atrox wouldn't be the best fit for them, but they both get ways to massively increase their nanoskills, as well as strong nano regeneration, which largely offset the disadvantages of atrox.  In addition, later on the huge hp pool and heal delta will be a godsend, particularly for NTs who have no heal nanos.

Atrox adventurer is fine too, you'll have more trouble with nanos and lower evades, but you'll have more hp and will generally do better with weapons.  Twinking will be tough, but it's hard to go wrong with adventurer no matter what you do.

Soldier, again, can do well with any breed.  Opifex can give that little boost to make evades somewhat usable, Solitus get that flexibility and the heal perk from the genome line, Nanomages get their shields earlier and at high levels get a second bio cocoon (via the Dreadloch Endurance booster, also known as ""the main reason to play NM""), and like with NT atrox get a huge hp pool and big heal delta that makes up for the lack of self-healing.

I think all of those professions are fun, though for different reasons.  Adventurer is super-flexible since the patch, and I've always got a grudge against them because they're just great at everything and get a ton of tools and gimmicks.  NT goes through some rough patches, but deals great damage now and the survivability is surprisingly high, especially since you'll have that hp bonus as atrox.  Soldier too is not normally a ""solo"" profession but if I were going to solo with it I'd go atrox, and it's an amazing tank in teams as well as a good damage dealer.  Trader can feel a little off-balance somtimes, the things it brings to the table aren't appreciated enough, and it's a little unfocused, but this can also make it fun because it's got a *very* broad set of tools and playstyles available.

Since you bring up the primary genome (i.e. Mongo Rage: the perkline), I'll assume you're looking at PvP.  I'm really not into PvP, but my general impression is that NTs are often crazy-strong, traders are extremely annoying and very fun to play, but sometimes lack killing power and are better with friends, soldiers can be beastly but generally need to be well-twinked to perform well, and adventurers excel in being neigh-unkillable, but unlocking their power to kill others is tougher.

To try to make a more clear ranking, in order from most to least, taken with a grain of salt because it's very subjective:  
The amount each prof will benefit from atrox's high hp and high healdelta:  
Soldier, NT, Trader, Adventurer  

The amount each prof will suffer from atrox's low evades, low nanoskills/pool and tough twinking:  
Adventurer, Trader, NT, Soldier  

The amount mongo rage will boost a profession's performance in PvP:  
Adventurer, Soldier, Trader, NT

The amount of fun I find each profession:  
Yes

But I will say, what you're saying in the math department doesn't make sense, unless I'm misunderstanding your words. Percentage of fire rate isn't cumulative, if you miss 2/3 shots on either weapon, the difference between the point that they die is still 5%. Is that a difference? Yeah, definitely. But it's small enough that the vast majority of situations will not be effected by it.

I guess it all depends on how much importance you put in those very few situations.

The camera fades in from black to a rolling shot of some rough ground. It then comes upon some boots, then slowly pans upward. First the pants, then the torso, then finally a closeup of Fords tired, old face in the iconic hat. 

His expression remains for a good few seconds, then his eyes widen, and the camera zooms out to show him swinging his arm upwards. As he brings it down we finally what he's wielding: his signature whip. It swings wildly in the air, in a motion so slow we can see every fiber stretch and crack. 

Finally it connects with dark brown, rotting flesh. The camera then cuts out to show the rest of this flesh: a dead fucking horse. Then the camera switches to a more plain view as Ford just wails on this fucker in real time. 

For 90 minutes. 

Finally, Ford falls over next to the horse and passes out from exhaustion. 

Then George Lucas walks out, faces the camera, then says ""Go fuck yourselves.""

WritingPrompts,1,0,1,"The cinema stinks of human sweat and popcorn, with a hint of fecal matter wafting from the closet storing the popcorn. I’m amazed the rest of the cinema is bearing the stench with grins. I keep one hand firmly on the shoulder of my sister. Closed spaces and I have many disagreements. 


Zix is too busy chatting away at me to notice the routine flinches, accompanied with continual scanning for exits. Occasionally I nod at her, encouraging her to continue chatting. She should be able to go to a cinema with her older sister, my fears are inane.


Approaching the counter for the horrendously overpriced food, at first Zyx wants popcorn, but I can tell she’s received a whiff of the many scents blending into the air. She points to a boxed candy, M&amp;M’s it reads.


I nod to the cashier handing over the local currency, still scanning the room as he hands me back my change.


“Have a nice day DI-A”


I freeze at the mention of the name, the pause between the letters. It lasts a half second before the pistol under my jacket scatters the cashiers brains across the popcorn machine. Zyx winces at me and comes sprinting over, dropping her candy to jump into my arms.


Guns. It was a setup. As we practiced, Zyx slices off the backpack I’m wearing with practiced strokes, too practiced for a five year old. In that moment, I feel much older than my seventeen years.


I shiver as my back is exposed to open air. Zyx plugs her ears with her fingers while I continue taking aim with my free hand.


“Behind!” Zyx calls.


In the same moment I spin 180 degrees, firing a shot into the chest cavity of our assailant. As the tattoos on my break from the skin, I grit my teeth in an effort not to scream. Zyx reaches up to touch my partially removed wings, and speeds the process up, that is her “gift”.


I spread my wings, the massive twenty foot wingspan dwarfing the lobby. It took the scientists decades to create the only human with natural flight abilities. I escaped the hellhole from which I was grown.


Understandably, they were angry.

Bitcoin,1,0,1,"&gt; That's not remotely true. As evidenced by Bitcoin currently.

This is true. But would you be in favor of keeping an inflation rate of 25 BTC every 10 minutes? I think this kind of statement is dangerous. If the devs ever announced that bitcoin will continue to inflate at a set rate for ever the price could plummet and a sounder crypto could eventually take over.

What im trying to say is if you want to keep the transaction costs artifically low you wil have to keep rewarding miners with newly minted coins. If you keep minting coins, you risk people abandoning bitcoin for a crypto currency that has a fixed supply.",t3_352a82,cr0ffu4,t1_cr0f1oz,t1_cr0ffu4

Wait... Stop dancing in front of me"" that worked for Ronan in Guardians because it *was* a nonsensical movie, then it's gonna go down poorly IMO.

PSO2,1,0,1,"&gt; To acheive power on this character, my friends tell me I will need a LOT of dex, like 2000 dex.

your friend has no idea what he's talking about.

dex is only relevant when you are talking about crafted weapons, and a good uncrafted weapon is always going to be better than a crafted weapon. the reason dex matters in that case is because all weapons have a natural damage variance, where an uncrafted rare weapon will always deal between 90% and 100% of the max damage. on crafted weapons, this range increases to something around 60% to 100% of max damage. dex increases your minimum damage.

perhaps your friend was thinking of the braver mag skill? (basically, the splits the dex on your mag into s-atk and r-atk, with each stat getting half your dex. this means a level 190 dex mag would give your base stats +190 dex, + 95 s-atk, and +95 r-atk). this only accounts for mag stats though, so dex souls/affixes are useless.

your attack power is going to be directly linked to the relevant attack stat (s-atk for katana, r-atk for bow). dex isn't going to factor in at all (aside from if it bumps up your minimum percentage) where as a real attack stat is going to boost your max damage (which in turn will also boost your min, since it's a percent of your max).

just be warned that dex mags are generally looked down upon, primarily because you are getting less of your stats than you would with a dedicated katana build or bow build, and you also are locking yourself into always having either br or bo somewhere in that character's build (because a dex mag is 100% useless without their mag skills to convert dex to atk). on top of that, there are some weapons that you won't be able to equip with a dex mag (without wasting skill points on stat up stuff), since the requirements are higher than what you'd hit at 75/75 with a 190 dex mag. you might be able to equip that stuff eventually once the cap increases, but new weapons will surely come out putting you in the same spot.

whatever you decide to do with your mag, you want to make it pure. i wouldn't necessarily recommend pure dex, but it's your only real option if you want to do a hybrid.",t3_34xas3,cr0pqys,t3_34xas3,t1_cr0pqys

We got a call about someone having GI distress, so we headed over. It actually turned out that some meth lab operations had gone amiss at this particular address, and most of the occupants were hurt. Weirdly enough, the one who claimed to need an ambulance was the one who needed it the least.

The whole story is pretty horrible and also kind of humorous, but I'm only going to stick to the ridiculous self-medication attempt.

When we walked in, we were assaulted by the smell of rotting flesh. Unfinished concrete floor, peeling paint, holes in the walls, and a woman lying on an ancient green couch that I'm not fully convinced was always green. On closer inspection, we find the source of the stench. I thought she was wearing some kind of legging at first, but most of her leg was black. It had been badly burned, gotten horribly infected, and parts had begun to just... rot. She had a high fever, her heart rate was through the roof, and to this day I'm not completely sure how she was lucid, but she was.

whowouldwin,1,0,1,"&gt;Not really; you can't even see it on good lasers or in flash mode
&gt;

No, I'm talking about the lasers in BoG. Some of them are tipped, which would lead to immediate spreading in real lasers. 

&gt;It's not part of the actual laser
&gt;

It's part of the device as a whole, despite not being a part of real world laser emitters. It's a way in which those BoG weapons don't act like lasers emitters. 

&gt;What do you mean?
&gt;

If those are lasers, that means that scene is slowed down, to the point that any of the moving parts of the laser emitter would be traveling at relativistic speeds. In a real device, that would dump an enormous amount of waste heat into the atmosphere. 

&gt;When did you reach the conclusion that the laser must be powerful enough hurt Vegeta? They're not even damaging the walls, so they clearly can't hurt Vegeta. i seriously don't get your reasoning here
&gt;

I'm using the fact that the lasers don't damage the walls as evidence that they aren't lasers, since Vegeta isn't a character that trains with things that can't hurt him. Which is more likely, that Vegeta is training with some sort of magic beam weapon (like every other energy weapon in DBZ) or that he's training with non lethal lasers? 

&gt;&gt;Sure they can. But they don't have to be

&gt;?

You said that, just because the emitter acts nothing like a laser emitter, doesn't mean it can't emit a laser. I'm agreeing that it could, but there's no reason it would have to emit a real laser, as opposed to some random magic energy beam. 

&gt;There isn't a single example or a beam that looks like a laser but doesn't work like a laser
&gt;

No there isn't. And that includes the image you linked. It doesn't look like a laser and it presumably doesn't act like one either. 

&gt;Source?
&gt;

Why would there be an energy limit on visible light wavelength lasers? 

&gt;Your argument that the lasers must be able to hurt Vegeta is based on your interpretation of Vegeta's personality, and not the available visual evidence?
&gt;

The visual evidence doesn't tell us anything. Every energy attack in DBZ magically passes through the atmosphere without leaving a mark and the vast majority leave only minor traces on what they hit (compared to the energy they contain). If you could prove that it was a real world laser, that would prove that it's a lower powered weapon. But you can't, so the evidence (i.e. Vegeta's character) suggests that it isn't.

Let's turn this around. What evidence do you have that those are real world lasers? ",t3_350cqv,cr0v540,t1_cr0ez2e,t1_cr0v540

However, ignoring previous moderators...

/u/meowmixID is actually someone I'd consider pretty well. He doesn't seem psycho and is overall a nice dude. He's a calm guy who I could see being good as a moderator.

/u/sonicmaster10 too. Maybe it's just that I see him being pretty cool about things and not making poor decisions. No idea if he'd be interested, but I don't think I'd complain to see him up there.

Yes, he still says this, but he also recently said (difficulty of making it friendly)&lt;(difficulty of making AGI).

From [his recent TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_bostrom_what_happens_when_our_computers_get_smarter_than_we_are/transcript?language=en) (emphasis mine):

&gt;The values that the A.I. has need to match ours, not just in the familiar context, like where we can easily check how the A.I. behaves, but also in all novel contexts that the A.I. might encounter in the indefinite future. And there are also some esoteric issues that would need to be solved, sorted out: the exact details of its decision theory, how to deal with logical uncertainty and so forth. **So the technical problems that need to be solved to make this work look quite difficult -- not as difficult as making a superintelligent A.I., but fairly difficult.** Here is the worry: Making superintelligent A.I. is a really hard challenge. Making superintelligent A.I. that is safe involves some additional challenge on top of that. The risk is that if somebody figures out how to crack the first challenge without also having cracked the additional challenge of ensuring perfect safety. ",t3_3535a2,cr1fh06,t1_cr1daia,t1_cr1fh06

That's a shame.  [If you're self-employed, you can save even more than most people using a SEP-IRA or an Individual 401(k).](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2013/02/13/how-entrepreneurs-can-get-big-tax-breaks-for-retirement-savings/)

For each of my investments, I look at both the current value of the investment as well as an estimate of what it would be worth after taxes.  I mostly do this to make sure my allocation is reasonable.

In many cases, taxable investments may be less effected by taxes in retirement because the capital gains tax rate is low (or at least it is currently) and only affects the the amount of the capital gain whereas income taxes are on the entire withdrawal taking money out of a Traditional IRA or pre-tax 401(k).

Of course, if you have some Roth assets, they are tax-free in retirement.

Anyhow, I haven't gotten further than considering the likely future taxes.

A four-game stretch, no matter how bad, is not a good indicator of a team's ability.  It's way too small a sample size.  Yes, it's frustrating watching your team lose games they should win, especially in the way we lost the first two Cardinal games.  But giving up leads in two consecutive games doesn't necessarily mean our bullpen is terrible or that we have a problem closing out games. 

Trends in baseball take much longer to establish themselves.

virtualreality,1,0,1,"tl;dr: I'm not totally convinced.

Well, I'll admit DK2 in stuff like Elite:Dangerous feels a lot better than on a screen, in terms of how easy it is to keep track of an enemy ship. I don't know that I would be happy with sanctions for being in VR, though. Not least because I think VR should be encouraged at its fledgeling stage, but more than that, some of us are dropping a ton of money on VR *because* it's such an experience. It shouldn't be castrated for the sake of other users. Maybe in the future, when the barrier to entry (system/money wise) is very low and the tech is widely used, you could start matchmaking based on VR or non-VR users. But that should be up to the users, not enforced.

I don't think the advantage is THAT enormous, either. There are counterpoints as well - DK2 users in air combat sims won't be able to see as far as people on normal, much-higher-resolution monitors. Everything out there is an indistinct blob. And I'm amazed when I see screenshots of Elite:Dangerous - it's so detailed it looks almost nothing like the game I'm playing in VR. I'm not sure how much better this is going to get on consumer kits in the near future.

And as a closing argument, how different is this to better graphics cards, smoother and higher frame rates, higher-res, larger monitors, lower latency Internet connections and equipment, more accurate mice and gamepads and control surfaces, etc etc?

gaming,0,0,0,"That video is so far off its ridiculous. Let's say Mario doesn't get gibbed and gets stuck to the bullet. Assuming Mario has a mass of 45 kilograms, right after impact he would be going about 11.5 meters a second. The near instantaneous acceleration would exert a force of 495 newton's throughout Mario body. Additionally, during the inelastic collision 3000 joules would be lost. To give you some perspective if the average male was shot in the center of mass by a 9mm bullet, and the bullet didn't pass through him it would be in the ball park of 400-500 joules.

PowerMetal,0,0,0,"I never liked Kamelot, but I gave a listen to all their album just to know why everyone was talking about it. There are some part of some song that I like, but overall I find it extremely slow and boring.

I can understand why people like their first albums, but this one was just terrible... Is that power metal to you guys? It really does not feel or sound like the power metal I know and love. 

Taken from the side bar: 
&gt;Dragons, Wizards, Power, Glory, Magic, Freedom; yup, it's all here. 

I guarantee youll find none of that in that album...

Also, people on this sub said that revolution was really good... but i cant see it. I really had trouble listening to it.

If someone made me listen to this album to show me what power metal is like, I would never listen to power metal again. Its slow, dark and depressing. 

I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion, but this band I just cannot understand. Im not trying to be offensive, and if this comment is for you kamelot fan, I apologize, but im completely clueless. Im just voicing my opinion in the hope that someone can make me understand how this is power metal...

WTF,0,0,0,"Florida teenager Ashley Hyde nearly went blind from an infection in her eye. Doctors were fairly stumped at first when they saw her extremely red eyes and blurred vision. But then they realized she had contracted an acanthamoeba infection in her left eye after failing to change her contact lenses regularly.

These microscopic parasites are normally found in water and soil. But the parasites went in her her eyeball, literally eating their way through, forcing doctors to operate in order to save Ashley’s vision. She describes what doctors did:

“They did multiple cultures where they scrape your eye. One time, they had to drill into my eye. It was really nasty.”

You might be able to pick them up later on, but if you don't have the mana to support your spells at the height of their power, then you might find yourself in a bad position. There will always be a situation where one item will be better than the other, but down the line. Early on, you need to be able to support for mana pool with more than bottle.

3. Alleras is Sarella. She is the only sand snake missing from Dorne
4. Pate is actually the faceless man known as Jaquen H'gar
5. R+L=J the show pretty much confirms it in the last episode, same with the vision of the flower growing on a wall of ice.

Pairing: Cas/Dean/Jimmy.  
Explicit.  
Summary:Dean and Cas have been together for about six months, when Cas starts to get antsy about their sex life. The sex has been good and all, but what Dean doesn't know is that his shy, sweet little boyfriend has been holding back. One confusing spur of the moment date with his boyfriend's twin later, and Dean finds out that Cas may not be as innocent as he thought.  

Comment: This started off as an innocent enough search, I wanted to read some more stuff with Jimmy.  Turns out, the incest is not the reason I can't get into wincest fic, it's apparently lack of Cas.  Mostly pwp.  ",t3_359xp2,cr2jino,t3_359xp2,t1_cr2jino

Unless we try to have variable degrees of influence in a given vote available to people whose stakes in the decision being made are different (and to do so would imply some measure of expected change in welfare that people could largely agree on) we seem to have to resort to equal voting rights and simply seek a majority (where issues can be made bivalent) or plurality (wherever there have to be multiple options). In either of these cases where the votes come from doesn't seem all that important, even where some people are inconvenienced.

Just because public opinion is divided on geographic lines in many cases doesn't mean that our democratic process ought to be regarding national issues unless there's good reason to believe that constituency system we have deals with the risk of a tyrannical majority with a low stake in the issue enforcing their desires on a minority with a higher stake any better than devolution of issues deemed local, with equal votes to all on national issues and equal votes to all those in a given area on local issues.",t3_357wnt,cr2mjz0,t1_cr2m58z,t1_cr2mjz0

Amazingly, there was no damage done at all.  But that was pretty much my cringe moment for a guitar.

For a mandolin, it's slightly worse.

Playing my new, custom-made mandolin while smoking a cigarette, an ash fell off and landed on the upper bout, leaving what seemed at the time like the biggest, most awful mark ever.

Since then, it's more or less disappeared through wear, but at that moment, I felt like I had just stepped on a kitten.

leagueoflegends,-2,0,-2,"I fail to see how this quote changes anything about him. I'm platinum and I already do that with my own role (support). That's simply knowing how your lanes goes.

You see, I think you have it backward. You say Dyrus is the glue that ties the flashy plays of Bjerg and Turtle together, but what I saw was Bjerg and Turtle always having the pressure because Dyrus is never gonna stand up and carry his team.

Turtle is known for doing weird flashes/jumping in the middle of fights, but I always saw those move past the ~30 min. mark. I can understand that, because when I play adc and my team runs around with its tail behing its legs I always end up trying to do some desperate play, to get this tiny edge, and try to work from there. I know I'd end up doing something similar simply out of desperation.

As for Bjergsen, I really can't tell if he wants to be in the spotlight every game (he does seems a bit cocky), but I know the pressure must be insane, knowing you're ""the best"" player of your team and not giving your team an advantage.

I'd give Santorin a chance. I've haven't seen him at MSI (did you? I'm pretty sure he's still in the TSM house), but he hasn't been in the league for too long, he has plenty of time to get a lot better on international stage.

Yes, Dyrus has had consistent performance despite the meta he's in, but I've never seen him carry his team single-handedly (except those jayce/vlad game, I guess, but that far behind). I'd like to see him perform on carry tops, but since I really started watching LCS regularly, I've always been displeased by his general performances. Not that he is bad, not that he is shaky, he simply doesn't carry, nor does he make insane plays where you're just baffled for the next 5 minutes.

Take *real* good top laners, like Smeb, or MaRin, etc. Yes, they are that solid rock at top lane, but they pull flashy plays consistently, and that's what makes them **good**.",t3_35cohe,cr3fkpz,t1_cr3ff99,t1_cr3fkpz

My aunt calls me and I lose my leg pump while she gives me the details of a trip I'm taking to GA to see family.  After the call I get under the bar and for the second time in my life I failed a squat.  Luckily I had the safety bars in place.  It was only 275 and I can normally rep that.

Fast forward 2 hours, I'm at the park playing basketball.  I play bb as an alternative to running for cardio.  We play for a hour or so.  I'm drenched in sweat, I literally wrung out my wifebeater and watched at least a cup and a half of sweat fall to the ground. 

I get on my motorcycle to leave. (2005 r6) I'm heading about 30-35 mph in first gear when I hear a clang, pop and grinding sound. Instantly turned off the engine and rolled to a stop.  Trail of oil behind me.  Not good. The chain I had installed 3 days ago broke right at the masterlink. Bmy license plate is bent from where the chain flicked up and smacked it.  Could have easily lost my leg.

I was in a particular bad part of town and wasn't about to leave my bike.  So I pushed that 450lb bike for a mile uphill to my friends house.  I am sore af right now.  I weigh 6lbs less than I did yesterday. Think I''ll take today as a rest day.

Regardless of whatever personal issues she might have, not being able to answer to such a trivial issue like this without shutting down is not OK.

For now, I'd say let her block her room with furniture and what have you. Go up to her door and tell her, ONCE, ""when you are less upset and ready to talk, come on out, I'll be waiting and I'll listen to you"". I promise you, she won't stay there forever. Once she's ready, ask her to explain WHY your comments bothered her to that degree. I think you can work from that.

What you need to understand tho is that you really did nothing wrong, according to the story. Asking someone to turn down their notification sound is a perfectly butterball request to make. Even ""snapping"" at someone the way you did after she threw her phone is a normal response.

One of the reasons the Conservatives won the election is that they aren't as tarnished with their *nasty party* image as they were by the end of the Thatcherite era.  That in turn can be partly attributed to the Liberal Democrats **very quietly** keeping them reined in.  When I say very quietly, my meaning is mainly that the Conservatives managed to claim most of the credit for Liberal Democrat policies.  Most notably the increases in the tax free amount on income.

Assuming the Conservatives opt to be as oppressive and aggressive as a lot of people are worrying about, once you accept they **will** be in power for the next five years the best way to move on is to let them reveal themselves.

Anarchism,1,0,1,"I agree with almost all of this. Clearly the people just wanted to make a principled stand to protest government interference. And I believe strongly in child emancipation and that parents don't have the right to isolate children, aggress against them, or control their movements and associations. So I'm definitely not down with these people insofar as they were resisting the agency just interviewing the kids.

That said, I do have a couple of worries. First, that the people were targeted solely on the basis of their libertarian beliefs. Lots of people abuse their kids, but so long as they do so within the confines of a suburban house, they're much less likely to get CPS called on them. In my opinion, child abuse interviews should be regularly conducted *for every child* not just on the basis of the parents living a unconventional (and importnatly, non-harmful) political life.

Second, taking away the kids seems like overkill. If you want to interview them, then by all means do so. But it seems like removing them longer than necessary for these purposes starts to become a problem (assuming that the kids do, in fact, want to return, which they admittedly may not).

Finally, I'm at least open to the idea that particularity matters. If the parents are abusing/oppressing their children and you remove the children, then you've acted justly. But if the parents aren't, then you haven't. So maybe if my research on the parents is correct and they are believers in non-authoritarian parenting practices, then the removal might not be justified. That said, I also see--and am probably more sympathetic to--the generalist point that the investigation is reasonable given the importance of emancipating children and that, given the lack of knowledge of those outside the family, those outsider are justified in taking reasonable measures to become informed regarding what goes on in the family.",t3_35bg3p,cr3of3e,t1_cr3iji0,t1_cr3of3e

At those depths, the rocks around you are hot. Touching them is not comfortable, and it's possible that you'll get burnt(not anything too drastic, just what you would feel when touching a really hot radiator.

In the mines that are not as deep, you usually only have to worry about providing enough air so your workers don't die. The ""comfortable"" work environment is considered to be up to 32 degrees(celsius). Anything above that and your hours get cut down to 6 from 8. 

Anyway, the air is supplied by giant fans. [No, really, they're the size of a building](http://www.stalkowent.pl/pic/WPK-2.gif). The performance is dependant on the model, and for ""normal"" mines is somewhere from 45 cubic meters to 450 cubic meters of air. Per second. The mass of those fans is up to 50 tonnes, without engine.

Now on top of that you have to add giant cooling stations, because if you were to just pump the air in, it would absorb all the heat from surrounding rocks and become unbearably hot.


The air from the giant fans and the main cooling station will not get to each and every corner of the mine, and it will not stay cool forever, so there are several smaller cooling substations and different smaller fans that help with that.",t3_35dwyh,cr3te40,t1_cr3q5ap,t1_cr3te40

This makes me think that you have not found a Christian devotion that is fulfilling, I recommend that you study Eastern Christian spirituality.

&gt; I've found myself wondering if my beliefs in Christianity can coincide with the principles and beliefs of Buddhism. I'm interested in the path towards Dharma (Enlightenment) and in the book, reincarnation is discussed as both fact and a precursor towards full enlightenment/attaining Nirvana.

AskHistorians,4,0,4,"Partially.

Nicholas II was a die-hard autocrat: he viewed himself as having a God-given right to rule over Russia, and was deeply reluctant to divest this power to others. Even after Russia adopted a constitutional system and an elected parliament (the State Duma) following the Revolution of 1905, Nicholas II adhered to the old conception of the tsar as a total autocrat. He viewed the constitution and the Duma as gifts he had given to Russia; gifts which he was at perfect liberty to take away if he saw fit. He distrusted the elected delegates of the Duma, and even reform-minded ministers in his own government, whom he saw as attempting to undermine his own power. This distrust was mirrored by Duma deputes, who saw autocracy as something which blocked Russian progress and development. Importantly, the Fundamental Laws of 1906 contained a number of loopholes and ambiguously-worded passages which made the exact location of power in the Russian system difficult to discern - the tsar could read the document as ultimately endorsing his continued personal rule, while members of the Duma could read it as implying power ought to lie with them or the government. The tsar's own intransigent adherence to the old system of autocracy meant that the constitutional system in place from 1906 failed to work - and, by the time of the February Revolution in 1917, leading figures in the government, the Duma, and the army had little faith in his abilities to solve the deepening crisis.

Nicholas also bought into the image of the tsar as a 'little father' to his own people. He believed that he had a special connection with the masses, knowing what their true needs were. This view was reinforced, to a degree, by the jubilant celebrations of the Romanov tricentenary in 1913. In Nicholas' eyes, then, members of the State Duma and the government were not truly representative of the Russian people, and so their views could be ignored. Increasingly, Nicholas surrounded himself with other like-minded persons and yes-men, who only reinforced his own beliefs. He held an oversimplistic view of the Russian people and the Russian state which, over time, became more and more detached from the increasingly complex (and troubling) reality.

However, challenges to the tsarist system emerged well before Nicholas II's rule. Problems can be seen as really taking root during the reign of Nicholas I (1825 - 1855). Nicholas I was a military minded man, who valued discipline and order over all else. He suppressed dissenting public voices (especially after the European revolutions of 1848) and did little to address the plethora of problems Russia faced during this period. It was during this period that educated society, both liberal and conservative, emerged as a force of opposition to the Imperial government His reign ended in the Crimean War, in which Russia faced a humiliating defeat at the hand of the British and French. This defeat underscored the desperate need for reform. 

His successor, Alexander II (1855 - 1881) was famous for his reform program: his reign saw the emancipation of the serfs, military reform, judicial reform, and reform of local government. However, public opinion on these matters was lightyears ahead of that of the Imperial government and the tsar: reforms, particularly emancipation, ended up as compromises which pleased few and disappointed many. Emancipation also left many former serfs in debt - little was done to actually improve conditions in the countryside. It was during Alexander II's reign that a revolutionary underground emerged: terrorist groups sprang up across the country, and many educated Russians 'went to the country' in an attempt to incite peasant rebellion and revolt (though they met with little success). There was a hope that Alexander II would institute some form of constitutional reform, giving Russia an elected Duma, but this did not materialise before Alexander was assassinated in 1881. 

His son, Alexander III was far more conservative - under his rule, freedom of speech was clamped down on, a process of extensive Russification was enacted (which served to alienate Russia's numerous ethnic and religious minorities), and anti-semitism became more prevalent. Despite this conservatism, Alexander III continued with economic reform and pursued a policy of rapid industrialisation in order to help Russia catch up with the industrial developments of the rest of Europe. This programme of industrialisation came with its own problems. Cities grew rapidly as men from the villages came to work in newly established factories. Conditions were poor, and dissatisfaction fuelled the growth of a workers' movement. Even though industrialisation made significant changes to the Russian economy, the country remained under-developed.

By the time Nicholas came to the throne in 1891, he was faced with: an increasingly reform-minded educated public who desired some form of constitutional system, with elected representation; a growing workers movement; a revolutionary underground with a strong tradition of violence; an indebted, and increasingly rebellious peasantry, reliant on outdated farming methods and technology; a very significant proportion of ethnic groups alienated by campaigns of Russification; and a state that was economically, institutionally, and infrastructurally underdeveloped. 

His personality certainly did not help the Romanov dynasty overcome the problems they faced at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries, and did exacerbate issues to an extent. However, the extent of the problems Nicholas II faces was truly vast: many issues had been brewing for decades. It is questionable the extent to which any tsar, competent or not, could have ensured the survival of the Romanov dynasty in the end, especially after the onset of the First World War.

Guitar,10,0,10,"I wish you luck. I'll add a bit of technical info---but you may find others who very-much disagree with me, so be forewarned.

There is a lot of opinion on then number of springs to be used and the exact arrangement of these springs. Some of what is said it silliness, but is believed by many.

There are two considerations when it comes to the springs. The total spring tension (total of all springs used, whether , 3 or 4), and the *spring-rate*. You can balance string-tension with 3, or 4 springs, but the spring-rate will be different. Spring-rate being how difficult it is to stretch the springs and how quickly they come back to the balance-point.

Most people find that (for light gauge strings) that 3 springs provide the most comfortable spring-rate. Many people (some of them knowledgeable and experienced players) believe that the springs need to be arranged in some specific manner, like the middle spring parallel to the body's centerline, but the outside springs slanted.

This is silliness. The baseplate and tremolo string-block of your Strat's trem move as a single unit, and only care about the total spring tension placed upon them. They don't care (as long as they are pivoting on the anchor screws correctly) if one spring is straight and the others are slanted, and basically ""see"" one big spring, instead of 3 or 4 individual springs.

But, like I said there are lot of people who don't see it the way I see it, and some of those people make a lot of money with their Strat's, so investigate these ideas for yourself.",t3_35ie42,cr4rg5o,t1_cr4qo06,t1_cr4rg5o

Just because there are many children in the system doesn't mean that it's easy. Have you spoken to anyone who has adopted? It's a process that can stretch across years.

Not all of those children are infants, which are less likely to have those issues. By ""baby to adopt,"" I literally meant a baby (a few weeks or months old) and not an older child, who will come with baggage the adoptive parents may not be capable of handling.

The problem here is, that they're *second best*. If trying to establish chemistry and whatever in such a team is hard enough, can you imagine having to keep up with *that* Barcelona? If that's not bad enough, the rise of Atleti blind-sided them last year, but they still went on to win La Decima. I don't think its all that black and white, I just think its kind of tragic that Madrid are in a position where they have to hit the bar set by Barcelona, and its even extended to Ronaldo, who used to have to compete with *just* Messi, but now has to worry about Neymar and Suarez putting up better numbers than him.

I can understand if it's for educational purposes, or just for fun, but I would strongly question the motivations and competency of a developer who is doing this on production software. 

* PHP is a web development language. It wasn't made for maths, therefore it's not optimized for very large numbers, so you're stuck using the relatively slow BCMath and GMP. Whereas in C you can do everything in polynomials which means lightening fast calculations using bit shifting.
* You'll get higher quality, faster development and testing time, if you use an existing tried and tested library.

I like PHP, but it seems to be a language which attracts a lot of 'developers' who don't follow best practices.",t3_35kf4z,cr5d26u,t3_35kf4z,t1_cr5d26u

truegaming,7,0,7,"Huge DF fan here - you're right that the game does a good job of generating plots and interactions between people, but it's also very grainy and lacks focus.

[It's All Random] Also don't forget that a huge amount of what makes DF seem so detailed is simply just random generation. A dwarf might have Granite as their favorite stone - not because they grew up in a granite-lined hall, not because their father was a mason who worked in granite, not because they killed their first goblin with a granite block - but because the random number generator chose Granite from a lookup table.

[Interactions are Good but could be Better] Dwarf Fortress has very inspiring self-referential abilities, for example a dwarf can craft items commemorating events. However we still have issues with the randomness and the presentation. A lot is still left to the viewer and a lot of context is being missed. Take a look through the legendary crafted items on /r/dwarffortress and you'll see what I mean, they all seem a little wonky.

[Too Many Details, Stick to the Point] When dungeonmaster to a game of D&amp;D, it's easy to get bogged down in side quests and useless details (*the shopkeeper's amulet is special to him because his third aunt Milly gave it to him before she left for the Elven Lands, bla bla bla*) and this is the same idea.

[Make a Plotline, then allow Small Deviations] I think if we're going to find useful interactive RPGs we'll find them more along the lines of Mass Effect than Dwarf Fortress - provide a structure of characters with motivations, then give the player actions to modify how they interact.

I'm still working my way through Mass Effect 3 so I can't say too much about its system, but so far it feels excellent. I'd like to see more of this.",t3_35l66o,cr5ixt9,t3_35l66o,t1_cr5ixt9

AoU was again, ok, entertaining, but has many problems (I think a director/extended cut will help it a lot, but I'm not sure how willing Marvel is to release a 3+ hour version)

On the show side... AoS is inconsistent, AC has an interesting character, but relatively boring show, and Daredevil was bloody fantastic. 

So far nothing they've released has been ""bad"", but there are definitely some weaker releases among the bunch. As the universe expands we'll likely see a couple bad releases, it's just bound to happen. The challenge will be bouncing back, and/or cancelling those out with spectacular releases. So far MCU, even for it's bloat, is trending in the ""good"" category. So I'm not worried yet. :)

summonerschool,1,0,1,"I think it's the weakest of the four jungle options.

I think they need to bring the dmg back up to make it viable again.  (Think this will/should happen especially after rise of the Tank jungle meta.)

It is so weak in early damage - though the atk speed is nice on junglers with an atk dmg buff and decent early clear, like Yi, WW, Udyr, Noc. 

I liked it early on Udyr, mimmicking the old Feral Flare style, just power stacking for 6 lvls then just coming out shredding. This is one of the few reasons it still works on WW.  But it just doesn't give you the damage you need to be relevant. Especially now that several junglers can go 1 damage item + Cinderhulk and be VERY strong and relevant even in early game.

So the government doesn't want to kill a bunch of citizens in a militia--no one wants that.  They are US citizens, our neighbors, no matter how misguided, they aren't the enemy.  So instead NSA should be informing intervention teams that then send out specialists--either advocates, social workers or spies to deescalate the movement with the attempt to resolve peacefully.

&gt;__Know your customer__ (__KYC__) is the process of a business verifying the identity of its clients. The term is also used to refer to the [bank regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_regulation) which governs these activities. Know your customer processes are also employed by companies of all sizes for the purpose of ensuring their proposed agents', consultants' or distributors' anti-[bribery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribery) compliance. Banks, insurers and [export credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_credit) agencies are increasingly demanding that customers provide detailed anti-[corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption) [due diligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_diligence) information, to verify their probity and integrity.

This kills two birds with one stone, so now we have a reliable winger for when Robben and Ribery hurt their arthritic joints, but in composite with Muller the winger/striker will be able to help shoulder Lewa's load, and open us up to more 4-4-2 strategies.

Advice,1,0,1,"Hmm. I think I get what you're going at. 

From the looks of this, you're unsure whether people like you or not, and if you are doing anything incorrectly. Women in a general sense can seem quite unpredictable and difficult to read, and I know I've had my fair share of that in interaction. It can be frustrating, but there are ways out of it if you play your cards right.

So far though, you're doing the right thing. You're making friends and talking to girls--that is a significant step up from the people who hide in their dorms all day and fuck around doing nothing. You're not Eliot Rodger by any means. 

One thing I can tell you, though quite difficult, is to not set any expectation with the said person. Don't live to have a girlfriend, but rather live for yourself, your own needs, and ideas. And 18 -- mate, you've got heaps of time. Remember, you've still got to adopt a career and lifestyle after college. Things will sink in eventually. Regarding the current girl, I'd continue to talk to her, be straightforward with yourself and your motives. Let the day-to-day relationship play out and continue your role as a friend. One thing though, don't get clingy, and don't be afraid to say what you think. Be assertive and straightforward with yourself.

DnD,4,0,4,"&gt; Is there anyway i could build something to hold the grid? Also I don't know where we would roll.

**Shopping list:**

* 1 inflatable pool raft
* 1 wooden board, about 3 feet (or 1 meter) squared
* Enough steel sheet metal to cover the top of the board (not stainless, as this will need to be magnetic)
* 1 can spray paint (white will probably work best)
* Glue that works on wood and metal / painted surfaces
* Black paint (for painting the grid)
* 1 roll of magnetic strip (the kind with adhesive on the back side)

**The Hard Part:**

Paint both sides of the metal with the spray paint, this will help to avoid rust.  Measure and paint your grid onto the painted metal.  Glue the metal to the board.  Cut the magnetic strip into 1 inch pieces and attach them to your miniatures.  Now place the board on the raft when you are ready to play.",t3_35pfja,cr6k1hj,t3_35pfja,t1_cr6k1hj

todayilearned,2,0,2,"In the fart most of the methane sulfer combos are a result of one stage or another of certain bacterial cycles. Example Both methanethiol and dimethyl sulfide are apart of one cycle, which is why they are the main players in anything stank.


On Venus it wouldn't be microbial (as far as we know) it would be raw chemistry. Venus is mostly CO2 with sulfuric acid clouds, methane clouds and odd pressure systems. When CH4 is passed through H2SO4 odd temperatures and pressures many if not all of the four horsemen will be made in some ratio of equilibrium.

Note I in no way am qualified to talk about chemistry in crazy places. I just know that here on earth it's not hard to manufacture these compounds from the precursors and on venus these precursors are in no short supply.

As for why they are smellier...I just went to ask my adviser about this. He has a PhD in bioaerosols essentially. His first question to me was ""Why do you think they are smellier?"". His statement is really that we have trained ourselves to be more sensitive to some of these over others. 

I was raised with well water so H2S tainted things are not so bad to me. However CH3S2 makes my eyes water. Is that human nature or just who I am?

Scientifically I can say that humans can detect the presence of methanethiol and dimethylsulfide in lower concentrations over H2S, which is why the latter is used as a propane additive. But does that mean smellier? I dunno. I guess its a philosophy question. 


Final stank note- There are other evil smell causers here on earth that are more violent than sulfurs, putricine and cadaverine for example, but the four horsemen of rot will always be found and will always cause humans to retch.",t3_35lgvk,cr6n6xy,t1_cr6k20e,t1_cr6n6xy

&gt;

&gt;The __American Letter Mail Company__ was started by [Lysander Spooner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander_Spooner) in 1844, competing with the [legal monopoly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_monopoly) of the [United States Post Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Post_Office) (USPO, now the [USPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Postal_Service)) in violation of the [Private Express Statutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Express_Statutes). It succeeded in delivering mail for lower prices, but the U.S. Government challenged Spooner with legal measures, eventually forcing him to cease operations in 1851.

TwoXChromosomes,1,0,1,"&gt; The smartest choice is to find the best legal way to employ people who will not be taking major leave of any sort.

I disagree; I think that the smartest choice is to have contingency plans and enough skills/competency overlap to be able to deal with contingencies. In fact, maternity leave is among the *most* predictable outcomes of hiring early- and mid-career employees (unlike catastrophic car accidents or other injuries, early-onset chronic disease and so on), and there should be capacity built into any well-managed company to deal with it.

As someone (perhaps many people) have pointed out in this thread, if women (and parents in general) are treated fairly and generously during their pregnancies and parental leaves, they will return to work as grateful and loyal employees who could be around for the long haul, rather than as resentful employees who are at work against their preference and better judgment.

PurplePillDebate,4,0,4,"&gt; That's incredibly sexist and misogynistic. And if you treat women like that or think of women like that, then you are a horrible human being and you will do badly with women.

Its the opposite when you think about it, women are not being given special treatment for having tits.

&gt;  You should treat women like that, like they're regular people, not some fuck-thing, all the time, 

Not even if they ask nicely?

&gt;  in the real world and on the internet. It's hard (no pun intended) because of our penises,

What is? How does having a penis make it difficult to treat women well? (now who's being sexist hmmm?)

&gt;  but if you really make an effort to do that, 

I don't.

&gt;  your social life will be better and women will like you more.

syriancivilwar,-2,0,-2,"No one has ever proven that it's even possible to set up a Western style democracy (a democracy that is not thoroughly corrupt and does not engage in widespread abuse) that can extend its control over the entire country, in countries with civil societies as primitive as those of Libya, Iraq or Syria, yet there are no shortage of people ready to topple the leaders of these countries for not bringing their states up to Western standards.

&gt;revolution was necessary.

Foreign intervention was not necessary. Qadaffi would have restored order if not for Western governments meddling in the country's affairs by putting in place a no-fly zone, starting a bombing campaign and giving aid to tip the balance in favor of the Islamist rebels. 

The attitude of believing it's one country's right to militarily intervene in the internal affairs of countries on the other side of planet, that it has no cultural relation to, and that it barely understands, is not helping the world in the least, and is to blame for much of the chronic instability and chaos in the Middle East.

autism,-1,0,-1,"Finally, this sub stops being an echo chamber for high-functioning autistics to bash an organization that's actually addressing the issue.

I'm sorry, but if you're here actually communicating and living even semi-independently and are able to generally function well enough in society to not be forced into a home, then you aren't as severely impacted as someone who can't.  The casual disregard of people who are on the lower end of the spectrum is disturbing.  It's selfish.  Like it or not, autism *is* a disorder that needs treatment for some.  If you like your autism and think it makes you special, fine.  Keep it.  But don't ruin the chance at a normal life for someone else.

I know some of you have these miraculous recoveries wherein you were diagnosed as low-functioning as a kid and have progressed mightily into adulthood.  Doesn't look like that's going to be the case for my kid.  Using echolalia as 99% of her communication, she actually said TWO completely original sentences today.  *Two.*  And /u/cakeisatruth, I know you love pointing out the handful of autistic people who don't communicate verbally and use different mediums, but understand that I, and many other caregivers and parents, have indeed tried everything.

The same tired rhetoric I see here is that since I don't have autism then I could never possibly know what my kid is going through.  Perhaps some of you need to take a step back from your own life and acknowledge the struggles of your brethren and realize this isn't just about you.

EDIT: Okay, I keep seeing the objection to AS spending money on prenatal research.  Do you honestly think that every woman who finds out she's carrying a child with autism will automatically abort?  Do you think that by finding the actual cause the goal will then be to eradicate it completely?  Nobody's going to order a mass execution of autistic fetuses.  Where's the objection to testing for Down's or any other inherited disorder?  Or is this sub once again just concerned with the problems that only affect them specifically?

This isn't Gattaca.  There are no eugenics programs, so this hysteria needs to end.  The first step to finding a cure is finding a cause.  So far, I've heard half a dozen studies blaming me for the wrong diet, or breathing the wrong fumes or merely living in the wrong place when I was pregnant.  I read one study saying my husband's sperm was probably malformed and that caused it.  BTW, there is *no* autism in either mine or my husband's families, so my daughter must be a unique case.  If it's not completely an inherited disorder, (which I don't believe it is), then it would be great advice indeed to tell expectant mothers to avoid certain things that would increase the likelihood.  Like they already do when they advise that we take special care to consume more folic acid during pregnancy to prevent having a kid with spina bifida.

One more thing: the definition of high-functioning is the ability to take care of oneself with little to no assistance.  If you can do that, good for you.  As of yet, my daughter is nowhere close to being able to do that.  If I die, who will take care of her as well as I do?  What if a family member dumps her into some third-tier nursing home and they abuse her?  It's not like she can communicate to anyone if something's happening to her.  I *need* to live long enough to see her function without me.  Do you know what that feels like?  Every time I read about people with autism being abused, I feel sick.  If I die before she's at least somewhat independent, she'll be alone and vulnerable.  It keeps me awake at night.

So in conclusion, if AS offers another parent the chance to not go through the terror I go through daily, then they need all the support they can get.  It might not come down to a choice of abortion or nothing.  It might simply be a case of do the right things while you're pregnant.  You are all freaking out about nothing.

AdviceAnimals,1,0,1,"But the value of the dollar has not kept up with inflation. I worked 39.5 hours a week earning $8.50 an hour when I was a freshman in college (fall 2011). Even if I were to work there 40 hours a week, every week of the year...that would not be enough money to pay for a year of school. A semester was about $10,000 a semester, I paid about $7,000 after scholarships even then..I'd have to take time off school to make money to go to school and saving every penny means I wouldn't have a place to live (maybe my car?) or food to eat. And THEN I could MAYBE pay for school. It's like $30k-40k a year where I was attending (that's tuition and living expenses). What job is out there that an 18 year old with about a year of work experience can get and make $30-40k? The school I transferred to is a lot cheaper and even here I wouldn't be able to pay and just work. It's about $11k a semester with tuition and living expenses after scholarships and grants... It's not reasonable when people say you can go through school and work to pay for school at the same time. The price of a college degree has gone up about 1,000% since the 1970s, I think that is something older people don't even realize or really think about. I hate that I'm 22 and $30k in debt but if you're family isn't wealthy, the only way you're going to school and getting a degree in a 3-5 year timespan is by getting loans. I have a lot of friends here that have their parents pay for their school out of pocket which is great for them, and maybe those are the youth you're talking about? But people in my generation work their asses off for a degree just to get to the real world and either be told ""you need a second degree"" or they just can't get/find a job in their field. So yeah, a few weeks after I graduate in December, I'll start my masters degree and when I finish that, I'll have 6 months until I'm saddled with all my bullshit debt probably for the rest of my life. Fingers crossed I don't end up dead before I can start paying my debt because if I die, my parents still have to pay off their portion of my student loans. And that is why I *know* the world isn't letting me win. That's reality. ",t3_35ra4u,cr7qtrh,t1_cr7jkkf,t1_cr7qtrh

gifs,1,0,1,"Yeah, take care of your teeth. I used to see the dentist very regularly growing up, and had no problems. I stopped when I was an adult. I went back for the second time in 20 years recently in response to some tooth pain. I had to get my wisdom teeth out. But the pain didn't stop. Apparently one of the wisdom teeth was coming in at a bad angle and smashing against the adjacent molar. (By the way, why are they called wisdom teeth when they're clearly very stupid?) Turns out the wisdom tooth did a number on the molar, and the nerve was pissed off. So they did a root canal. And I just finished the last of the procedure yesterday. Two months and a bunch of visits later--initial exam, two cleanings, extraction, follow-up, root canal, follow-up--I think I'm fine. Oh, and even with insurance (and pretty good insurance, I'm told), I'm still paying at least $1000 out of pocket. And I still need to go back next year for more repair work when my insurance resets.

Catholicism,6,0,6,"&gt;You aren't doing that to celebrate something immoral, you are doing it to make money. The celebration of immorality would still occur without you acting so you are not a cause of the immorality in any way.

The same for the God Hates Fags sign maker. He's doing it to make money, and it would still go on without him. They can still have a parade without your sign.

&gt;I would say no but not because they are actively participating, but because no greater good can come from this. The sign can only be used for hate speech towards another group, it does not discriminate against a class of people like discriminating against gay people is. It thus fails the morally licit test for providing a greater good or preventing a greater evil. Something providing flowers for a gay wedding passes.

Why can the sign only be used for that purpose? I didn't say what the sign said. It could just say ""AVOID EVIL."" And I don't know what you mean by ""it does not discriminate against a class of people like discriminating against gay people is."" What is the ""it"" here? And if you have a problem with the use of actual language, think of a different scenario. Parade (or party) organizer for the parade who goes out and buys the things necessary for the event.

Incidentally, I have no idea why this ""providing a greater good or preventing a greater evil"" standard has anything to do with anything. I know people like to assume just base-utilitarianism in every moral discussion, but it's just not an automatic standard. And moreover, whether a ""greater good"" can come from providing the flowers is *exactly what's at issue*. You're just assuming it provides a greater good, when that's what we're debating. You're also, it appears, assuming that it's ""discriminating against a class of people,"" which is also exactly what's at issue. The florist here isn't. The florist is merely discriminating against a particular *event*. The ""class of people"" (their orientation) are irrelevant.",t3_35tx2u,cr7xdqy,t1_cr7wys7,t1_cr7xdqy

Hachiman tries to take responsibility for his actions by not putting the burden on the rest of the club, but by doing so still falls into that same trap as before. Thought this time, you could say he’s doing it of his own choice, for his own reasons. 

The meetings are hilarious, none of the stuff the other student council says actually *means* anything. It’s literally all buzzwords with no specific plan. Oh, and absurd hand motions, because every speech/communication class tells you to use hand motions when speaking. Basically the epitome of the sort of superficial crap Hachiman chooses to not participate in, except taken to a higher level. Hachiman proves this after spouting some nonsense even he doesn’t understand and they eat it up. Iroha’s trapped in her inexperience as well as peer/societal pressure and can only act as a doormat for all of the other school’s demands.

At best the atoms have been reduced to quarks... maybe even reduced to pure energy.

We know for fact that Dr. Manhattan does not need his body, or even his original atoms because they were all taken away from him... twice!  Thus, Dr. Manhattan is not the same thing as Dr. Manhattan's body, because you can destroy one without harming the other at all.

&gt; Springfield, MA - Joseph Buffis, former police chief of Lee, Massachusetts has been accused of embezzling more nearly $60,000 from a holiday fund which was supposedly set up for underprivileged children.

&gt; The investigation began when Buffis required two former Lee innkeepers to make a $4,000 &amp;quot;Donation&amp;quot; to the toy fund that ultimately ended up in Buffis&amp;#039; pocket, according to prosecutors.

&gt; In March, attorneys for Buffis moved to suppress key evidence in his trial that described how he extorted the funds.

freefolk,1,0,1,"&gt; Sansa is not one of the initial five that were meant to survive the series (Jon, Tyrion, Dany, Arya and Bran).

That outline is so far off from what we've seen in the mid-series that it's hard to take any of it as more than a general guideline of what might happen.

&gt; Her storyline was altered in the show, which can imply that her role in TWOW is minimal.

Alternately, this might mean that the show is taking a different path to get her to TWOW. This combination of things could lead us to the same circumstances we see on the show:

* BookSansa's Vale activities don't have a significant impact in the long run (i.e., the Harry the Heir plot won't go anywhere substantive).
* in both formats, the Boltons will lose the North, so whatever Sansa is doing with them on the show is unimportant because they will be removed soon.
* BookSansa will reveal herself in the North after the Boltons are removed. This is sped up for ShowSansa because she's already there. ""The North Remembers"" is explicitly linked to ShowSansa and the same could be done with BookSansa post-reveal.",t3_35sxb9,cr85k3z,t1_cr7ksjt,t1_cr85k3z

*****
&gt; Our new analysis of labor force estimates is based on the monthly Current Population Survey, which serves as the basis for the official unemployment rate and labor force counts announced by the federal government each month.

&gt; Generation X&amp;#039;s labor force participation rate peaked in 2008 at 84%. In 1998, Gen Xers were roughly the same ages as today&amp;#039;s Millennials, and that year, only 80% of the Gen X population was in the labor force.

&gt; In 2012, the Gen X labor force overtook the Baby Boom labor force to become the largest generation in the workforce, but that likely ended this year.

Ένα βιντεάκι από το Computerfile: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI που μιλάει για αυτά τα προβλήματα.

Δυστυχώς οι κανονικές εκλογές έχουν περάσει πολλά iterations ώστε να φανούν οι αδυναμίες και να φτιαχτούν κανόνες και μηχανισμοί για την αποφυγή τους. Στις ηλεκτρονικές εκλογές είμαστε πολύ πίσω ακόμη και όσοι την υιοθετούν θα πρέπει να ξέρουν ότι υπάρχει διαβλητότητα μέχρι να εκπαιδευτεί η κοινωνία σε αυτό (ώστε να αλλάξει ανάλογα και τα προγράμματα ψηφοφορίας).

To Πρόγραμμα που συζητάς φτιάχτηκέ από το ΕΔΕΤ σε πολύ μικρό χρονικό διάστημα και έχουν γίνει θέματα σε σχέση με την ασφάλεια του. Αν θέλουμε κάτι που τρέχει χρόνια, μάλλον θα πρέπει να κοιτάξουμε κάπου εδώ: http://www.scytl.com/en/",t3_35t0f5,cr8mb5s,t3_35t0f5,t1_cr8mb5s

If you have been watching Aphro streams lately, you'll probably notice what Scarra said.

It doesn't really threaten above *and* in front unless you're jumping forward, which is a fairly big commitment that can be punished by Peach. Off the top of my head, the only real ways they have to cover that forward air space is a sh-forward upair, turning around and bairing, WD-forward up-smash, or some king of nanapult blizzard. All of those methods have pretty big issues, they generally either come out slowly and can be reacted to or take very hard reads and can be heavily punished.

wiiu,2,0,2,"Thank you for your response.

My router and Wii U are right next to each other, so from a wireless perspective we can eliminate distance as a factor.

Regarding my wired connection, it's mostly the same for both the Wii U and the PC. Device to Ethernet Cable to Router to Modem. The only difference is the presence of the usb-ethernet adapter on the Wii U. It's definitely not a problem with my wired connection--unless there is an issue with my usb-ethernet adapter.

I take issue with the fact that Nintendo advised us to use the wired adapter in the Smash Direct, yet my numbers (and apparently other people's numbers) actually show that the wired connection performs worse--in upload-download speeds and ping.

There are enough people who complain about lag issues in Smash that it's worth it for the community to explore which solutions provide the best results. I'm actually amazed that you report no problems.

And before people chime in with the idea that Smash is peer to peer and if your opponent lags, I will lag--I'm already aware of that issue. 

The thing is I think that makes it even more worth it to create a guide for achieving the best possible results and spreading that guide through various communities and sites that could benefit--such as r/Nintendo, Smashboards, MK8 forums, etc.

But if we're actually fighting against device limitations, that's a definite issue.",t3_35y697,cr90ik1,t1_cr8x14c,t1_cr90ik1

Now I drive a wrx and everytime I pass one I wave because they do it too. Out of all the wrx/sti that I pass I have about a 90% wave back. I've probably passed easily 40 and only 4 haven't waved back. Some even initiated the wave.",t3_35wmc5,cr90k5r,t3_35wmc5,t1_cr90k5r

BabyBumps,8,0,8,"I used to use Glow to track my periods, and then I used their Nurture app when I first got pregnant. But I was actively looking for another option because the community there is *toxic*, and full of a particular brand of conservative religious people. 

Don't get me wrong: I have nothing against conservative people or religious people as a general rule, but this *particular* type of women tell other women they're going to hell for having an abortion, and spout their holier-than-thou attitudes everywhere they can stick their noses in.

Some people like little kids. That's not healthy for anyone and these people should be given therapeutic help to prevent them from hurting others (rather than being left to their own devices). Other people think they're part planet, or dragon, or cat. That's not healthy for anyone and these people should also be given therapeutic help.

fantasyfootball,2,0,2,"I think you summed it up exactly, you are building a team of consistency, and waiting for your opponent to stumble. This will almost always lead you to have a quality team and be in contention. But i think you would be less likely to have an ELITE team. I would much rather build a team that when i send them out there on Sundays, they have a high potential of going off. If youre playing H2H, the playoffs are tricky because it only takes one team to have a great week to take you out. My main league, 6 teams make the playoffs. With the top 2 seeds getting the bye. If your team is a consistent, a bit above average team as you seem to have a plan to churn out every year, youll likely finish around 3-6 every year. This would mean youd have to win 3 consecutive weeks in a row to win the title, dangerous with a team that will put up consistently quality numbers, because it will only take you one big week from an opponent to lose. I prefer to be the opponent with a very high ceiling of scoring at the risk of being inconsistent. Also the ELITE QB theory i posted, is only really relevant with 6 point passing TDs. Its not smart if its only 4 pointers. We also have small bonuses at 300 and 400 yards. So that changes things.",t3_35u2lo,cra1fsy,t1_cr8tu5q,t1_cra1fsy

vancouver,6,0,6,"I mean, let's take Dunbar. It has electric transit and could easily support frequent transit network service levels. It has a convenient location for many people working in Broadway, Downtown, or UBC, but they aren't building much at all on Dunbar simply because no one wants to make that fight.  Stong's would be quite happy to ditch their parking lot for high density housing blocks on top of their grocery store, as would other businesses, but they get a mountain of community pushback from the local reactionaries.  Most of Dunbar is fronted by small parking lots and single family homes.  How is this a sensible public policy? 

You could benefit many thousands of people by upzoning the whole flank of Dunbar and you could do it with transit-oriented development.

nfl,9,0,9,"I think the browns will be lucky to eclipse .500 this year and I was going into this ready to defend the 2010 team but man do we look better today. 

McCown is probably about as good as delhomme was at that point. People are probably a little more excited about manziel than they were about McCoy. 

West and Crowell are easily better than Jerome Harrison.

 Bowe, hartline and Hawkins are easily better than robiskie, massaquoi and cribbs. (Interestingly robiskie and hartline were college teammates, went in the same draft, the browns drafted robiskie in rd. 2, hartline went in 4, hartline's career has been way better) 

Watson beats any of our tight ends, even his old self, we could use a TE of his caliber on our current roster. 

Our O-line had the same fixtures with Mack and Thomas, but was only an average unit, their supporting cast has gotten better.

Robaire smith, ahtyba Rubin and Kenyon Coleman were nothing special. Rubin was good. The others were serviceable at times, similar to our 2014 ends but there's reason to believe the line could be better in 2015.

Our linebackers were pretty good. I liked Fujita, Jackson and gocong. Kruger, Dansby and Robertson/kirksey are similar. If Mingo/orchard generate a consistent pass rush they could put this year's corps over 2010's, which is saying a lot because the linebackers may have been 2010's best position group.

The secondary is where the current team is miles ahead. Tj ward was good. Sheldon brown, Eric wright and abram Elam all struggled and don't hold a candle to Haden, whitner, Gipson, Williams/Gilbert.

We did have one of the league's best kickers and returners in 2010, two things we sorely miss today",t3_36316o,craa26c,t1_cra8by1,t1_craa26c

politics,1,0,1,"&gt; If you've decided global warming isn't real then it would be worse than funding electric trains.

I am not accusing of subscribing to these views. But given the quoted line above the next obvious question is ""how did you come to this conclusion?"" And I guess it depends on the talking point a politician is issued that day, but invariably the excuses come up short. These same politician's go on record attacking and questioning science, using the bible as an excuse, or something else equally ignorant.

The only opponent of climate change investments and research that I have run into that are intellectually honest, I believe, are those that accept that humans are likely influencing climate change, but would prefer to not address it because of how it could affect jobs or the economy in the short term. If that's the reasoning, then say it. But there's a significant portion of the Republican party for whom that may be the reason, but for either reasons of pride, or whatever it may be, feel the need to deny the science. It becomes insidious when not only do they deny the science, that they get so tired of it that they defund it from every happening. ",t3_360rnp,crab9wk,t1_cra6t06,t1_crab9wk

videos,4,0,4,"Personal anecdote:

Bill Cosby spoke at my graduation ceremony the last year he was still on the Board of Trustees at my University, prior to Hannibal Buress's bit and the ensuing rape allegations. This video reminded me very much of the maybe 15 minute speech he gave at the ceremony: incoherent anecdotes and allegories that didn't really coalesce into anything that resembled a concrete thought or idea. I don't remember specifically what he said, but I remember thinking, ""what the hell does this have to with this class/ceremony/fucking real life."" I felt like the entire crowd needed cue cards to let us know when to laugh, as the lines between the comical and sincere parts of his speech were so blurred people seemed to not know what was a joke and what wasn't.

Anyway, I don't know too much about the Cos, but I can say he gave a seemingly incomprehensible speech at my graduation ceremony not too unlike his attempt at metaphor in this video.",t3_3630gl,cram36e,t3_3630gl,t1_cram36e

asktransgender,2,0,2,"From the tone of your post you have some shame about potentially being trans*.

Typically, transitioning to fulfill a sexual role is not a good idea. If you were to medically transition your libido would change and then who the hell knows how you'd feel.

As a matter of fact the guide by which medical personnel use to diagnose ""gender dysphoria"" (formerly referred to as having Gender Identity Disorder"" states that a transition for societal benefit does not classify someone as suffering from gender dysphoria.

You can be very open an honest here, no legitimate member will shame you for being who you are. I think it may be a good idea to elaborate on some of those fears confusions and questions so we may do our best to answer them. If you cant get the words out now then whenever you have the opportunity and get them down.

You will almost definitely benefit from talking to a therapist specialized in gender issues.

Prohibit alcohol? Hello prohibition era. Didn't stop people drinking. But made a whole lot of criminals rich. Prices go up, quality goes down.

Start a war on drugs? Suddenly the drug prices skyrocket and an entire industry of smuggling them in and addicting people to them is born.

Could never drink too much before, even fizzy drinks, and I would fart like a trooper if I got bloated. It quite often cut nights out short though, as I would just get way too uncomfortable.

A couple of times when out I would get so much upper bloating (stomach rather than gut) that I would think I was about to be sick, and just wretch lots and lots of air, making lots and lots of noise.

Couple of years ago I bought a filtered water flask ([Britta](http://www.amazon.co.uk/BRITA-Water-Filter-Bottle-including/dp/B00BG9DHD6) type), which has a straw that goes down to the bottom. This made me drink water more, but with less air being gulped down. 

After only a couple of weeks I was making very small, involuntary burps (with no bloating), once every 4 or 5 days, which would become more and more frequent. Within a month I was burping randomly every day, and now I burp whenever I drink something fizzy and sometimes after eating food really quick (something tasty like steak or chicken).

I still occasionally get mega bloated but it's very rare and probably down to something I've eaten - only happens every few months or rarer, and probably something that happens to most people occasionally.",t3_365lgt,crb3c76,t1_crb34zr,t1_crb3c76

smashbros,1,0,1,"&gt;That shouldn't matter when the quality is better than most other on this sub to begin with.

It is a rule, you cannot break it or make an excuse for why you broke it.  If you break it your post gets removed.

&gt;Right in the title i said the video was recorded at work. If that was in error to my part, i apologize, but it is hardly grounds to remove a video entirely.

It is a rule, you cannot break it or make an excuse for why you broke it.  If you break it your post gets removed.

&gt;Already explained this. The video is about more than the 9 Hammer.

You missed the dair but that wasn't a frametrap or anything. The only reason you landed the 9-hammer is because your opponent was a scrub that missed his own dair and landed in front of you.

&gt;I didn't give him a chance to play well. Of course it looked like poor skill on his part.

No he is clearly playing poorly only jumping straight up in the air and missing all of his attacks.

&gt;Combo's aren't everything, and never should be. There is more to skill than just comboing.

You're right, it doesn't have to be a combo, but the clip has to at least be interesting, which this isn't.

&gt;Doesn't make you right. Rules should never be set in stone, because that means that people who it shouldn't be affecting are being affected by it anyways.

If you don't think I'm right then message the other moderators.  Your post is EXACTLY the kinds of posts these rules were put in place to get rid of.  You weren't accidentally caught in a technicality.

&gt;I am fairly certain right now, that if i had this video taken with out the shaking, and only grabs, up air and side air combo's being used, that there wouldn't be a problem with it. However my KO doesn't fall into that cookie cutter you seem to be keen on, and so my post is being treated unfairly.

All you did was press side-b, get over yourself.

&gt;I remember at one point, being able to get a quick kill on someone, no matter how it was managed, was considered skill.

If done skillfully then yes, if only 1 button is pressed to activate a move which is SUPPOSED to kill in one move and especially when it is used on a bad player, then it has absolutely no merit at all.

&gt;Whatever happened to that? No one gave a damn about video quality back then.

You didn't post this back then, you're posting it now.  Video quality matters now.  You can click the link I sent you earlier to have it converted to HD.

&gt;Which is why i feel that you are wrong about this, and even if you ban me, i won't care because you are just being insulting now with your assessment. Which by the way makes you a giant fucking dick, but whatever. Doesn't seem to matter to you. Not that i am really all that surprised.

I don't ban people just for having a disagreement with them.

&gt;So, to recap. You're wrong, your rules are not properly fleshed out, and go ahead and ban me for saying it, because it's not like free speech matters to you anyways i would bet. Never seems to with Reddit moderators anyways. Being the little dictators that many of them are.

Get out of your fantasy world.  Not every moderator is an evil dictating nazi.  You broke rules so your post was removed.  That is ALL.  I'm not mad at you, I'm not going to ban you, I'm not out to get you, I'm not calling you names or bullying you, I'm not deleting your comments and silencing you, I didn't even come up with that rule.  I'm doing my job as a moderator and removing your post which breaks rules.  You don't get to make up 1000 excuses as to why you broke all the rules and get off scot free.  This is what rules are in place for.

But how does this factor if the object (say a large rock) is thrown into a train travelling 50 to 60 mph?  Does the train's momentum make the rock hit that much harder, such as hard enough to shatter glass? ",t3_3663c5,crbgvr4,t1_crb1nlj,t1_crbgvr4

**Seven seconds.** “Geez, relax man!”  I say coolly, trying ease Franklin nerves. “I’ll keep them busy, you worry about the president and his girlfriend.” Honestly, I personally see what’s so important about this whole scandal thing. Don’t voters forget all this trash on Election Day anyways? 

**Six Seconds.** Franklin nearly growled at me, obviously not impressed with what ever I'm doing.

**Five Seconds.** Alright, what do you say when the president is caught in a compromising position with a secretary and few bottles of white wine? You don’t. You avoid it. Yeah, that’s it. 

**Four Seconds.** Talk about his achievements so far with political relations with Iran and Afghanistan? Maybe, yeah that should work. Need to also hammer in how many jobs he made for Americans in the last three years. 

**Three Seconds.** No, if I even mention or allude to the president that’s only to bring to attention this political disaster. 

**Two Seconds.** Shit! Out of time, I’ll just have to go with it for now. 

**One Second.** I stare at the teleprompter, only one word stares out at me. “Stall”

“I’m Vincent Grey, I represent public relations of the white house.” 

“I would like to remind all Americans, everywhere, that President Anton has done a great many things for this country.” 

“He, - , He was a contributor to the stabilization of the Middle East and has brought this country out of the economic depression that has ravaged this country.” 

“In the last year ALONE, President Anton gave more than nine hundred thousand new jobs last year, and eighteen hundred more two years ago. Anton has lead us from the depths of corruption and debt, to the supper nation we are today!”

“So in this highly connected world, we need to do our part for society. Anton’s future plans to strengthen trade relations with Canada that will re-establish our political relationship with them and generate future jobs for great country!” 

“By finishing the oil pipeline, we can secure a better future for our nation, to and ensure we can forever prosper as a wealthy nation!”

“I would like to use this moment to say something personally. For the three years I have worked with President Anton, nothing has been short but amazing. President Anton is a man of many talents and a man of personal stability.” 

“He often speaks to me and tells me about his dreams for this great nation. How the common man can find a stable income, where the nations of the world won’t laugh at us for our incompetence.”

“He admits however, that these are dreams. But all our dreams can come true, if we have the strength and determination to follow through, we may last have the American dream. Because when we are united as one nation, united under one flag, we can accomplish anything!”

A few hours pass before the camera turns off. I rub the bridge of my nose in tiredly. “Well Franklin, you think it was enough?”

	Standing to the side of the camera, Franklin stood with his arms crossed. “It was fine.” He said. “It could have been better though.” 

	“Damn it dad, how hard is it to impress you!?” 

	“Well for one, by not whining like a spoiled brat.”

	At that I shut up. Franklin never really cared for small talk or anything trivial. It’s all work for him. 

Franklin tilted his head to the side. “Apparently though it was enough to buy some time for Jennifer to come up with a cover story to tell the press when they get word of what’s happened.” 

	I walk off stage and start heading to the front door. “I’m going to get a coffee, want to come?” It was a weak attempt sure, but it always seems can’t reach my dad’s exceedingly high expectations. 

	He shrugs, and joins me as we head down to the cafeteria.

the 2000 US Open at Pebble is a great one to watch to get an idea of how much better he was than anyone.  Also the open championship the same year he won and somehow didn't hit into a single bunker.  it was amazing stuff.

That's exactly what it is: *modus tollens*. It's a perfectly valid argument form which is used in science and philosophy all the time, especially when we're doing something like defining a concept which we already know how to use and apply.

&gt;I would suggest that it's useful to have a word for things we can prove

Things that absolutely cannot be false? We do: ""incorrigible"".

Of course, in really complex subjects, I will have to take notes. But in most subjects, I learn much more efficiently by not taking notes.  Note taking is a good skill to have, but often times they would grade notes for something where it actually made it tougher for me to learn it.  

Most teachers would be content with being confused when I didn't take notes and would ace the tests.

Alcatraz island: book your ticket days before. I heard they can be sold out for even a week in advance. It's summer. Alcatraz is over rated but it's an absolute must if you saw the film, The Rock.

I recommend paying for the""RedBus"" that takes you all around SF. It will take you to all the sights.

Don't don't don't don't don't use your car on SF. Parking at hotels can be $20-$40 EXTRA and you won't be able to enjoy your trip as you won't be able to find any parking. Also, SF has one of the best public transportation in the USA. Use trolley, bus and BART.

IN PORTLAND: the Taiwanese and Chinese gardens are nice. Get Voodoo Donuts. Definitely get to Klamath Falls, Multanumah falls. There are three waterfalls all within a twenty minute drive. 

When you're back in L.A. check out Venice beach and Santa Monica. It's like you're in a California movie.

make sure you have enough gas in between L.A. and SF if you take three scenic route Highway 1. There's one spot i remember doesn't have many gas stations for a good stretch.

Look up Big Sur. I think it's nothing special but it's frequently on best scenic routes in the world lists (that makes me laugh). See the elephant seals too.

DebateFascism,2,0,2,"&gt;Forgive me if I am misunderstanding, I am just trying to summarize: You believe every race should unite and then organize amongst themselves, I think, right?

No problem.  I have no issue answering this question, it's pretty common.

Yes, you would be correct in that summary as well.

&gt;Do you think a black male should be allowed to live in the German sector of society?

Well, of course.  A black male, a black female, it doesn't matter.

Segregation without discrimination is what I'm describing, and even then, the aspect of segregation needs to have limits.  So, for instance, it would not be legal to make someone sit at the back of the bus because they're black or whatever, but each geographic region would be specific to a native group of people.

All races should have their own land they can call home no matter what happens, but they should be allowed to enter Europe or America too, and they should not be faced with outright discrimination wherever they live.

In Germany, the Germans would be given top priority during a food shortage or a national crisis because they are native to that land, but the same thing should be expected in a unified Africa.  The natives would be given top priority over all immigrants but only during an emergency or crisis.  That is the most important thing to note.  A nation should not be throwing other racial groups to the lions from the get go.

Part of the NS program is that a nation needs to be able to freely ship immigrants and their wealth back to their homeland for the sake of protection if they cannot be supported in the country they moved to for whatever reason.

That would be the only reason they would not be given entry into another nation.  Otherwise, they should be allowed to come and go as they please.",t3_35vftc,crc6i8c,t1_crc5mci,t1_crc6i8c

In the case that the cards are stacked against you, you can still control your own fate.  

You can wallow in self-pity that shit sucks and you'll never get a girl.  That doesn't help anyone, especially getting women.

You could completely be angered by your situation and shake your fist at the sky.  But that doesn't fix anything either.

Or you can accept your situation, know that things are hard, put a smile on your face, and move forward.  Know that you'll be facing the world alone, at least for a while, and that the tough journey ahead may unexpectedly help you find ""the one.""

I tend to look at the last bit.  I was never in a relationship until my late 20s and found a great woman, had a great relationship that unfortunately ended and am still close with.  But it also meant that, goddamn it, I have the ability to find the right woman, that the person *does* exist.

If for example, if you think you have an engine fire, the first thing you should do is call the fire deparment. Then get your fire extinguisher, pull out the pin and give it a short press to test if it actually still works.
Pop open the hood from inside the car. DO NOT open the hood anyfurther than that. Oxygen will rush in, the fire will expand and you will likely burn yourself. Instead, try to extinguish the fire through the slight opening of the hood. Again, even if you think the fire has been extinguished, do not open the hood any further. Step away and keep yourself at a safe distance.

Usually, a fire extinguisher will just buy you time, and that is all. I remember one particular tragic accident in the news were people were trapped inside a burning the car. The onlookers, despite having an endless supply of fire extinguishers from other cars passing by were not able to controle the fire and had to their dismay step away because it just got too hot to still get close enough to the car.",t3_36a6t7,crcljcd,t1_crcc05k,t1_crcljcd

progressive_islam,1,0,1,"&gt; The problem is we are totally disunited. On a sectarian level, we are too busy pointing out our differences or even declaring takfir rather than emphasising our commonalities. I am an Ahmadi. Even if someone thinks Ahmadis are kafirs, they should recognise Ahmadis in accepting the oneness of God and that Muhammad (sa) is his messenger and that the Quran is the final law have far more common with other sects than they have differences. In the same way, all sects should emphasise their similarities and not worry about takfir and other differences as much. Fine, theologically believe Ahmadis (or any other sect are kafir) but recognise our commonalities and unite peacefully for the greater good in mutual causes for our nations.

You are right on that part.

&gt;I always pray these problems are resolved. For the time-being, without divine intervention, I only see things getting worse because of the actions of the Muslims themselves.

It was that gun, but without the accessories. Cops would come at night and just tell us to go home. They would walk up and we would all be wearing face masks, cammo pants, holding real looking guns, and none of the cops who came ever even kind of thought they were real.

Some latino kid was holding some shitty plastic pistol at a park near me and got blown away. Of course he didn't put the gun down and was pointing it at people. It was probably way more likely that kids could have pistols rather than machine guns that you can't import to the US.

I'm just saying that we're not predisposed to be monogamous (although undoubtedly some individuals are more comfortable with one person for life)

N.b. I don't really see serial monogamy as 'monogamy' in the sense we're discussing. 'Monogamy' I take as partnering with one person for life. Some penguins do it. And I think a subspecies of vole. There are undoubtedly others.",t3_369g2l,crcueni,t1_crctpsp,t1_crcueni
crusadersquest,1,0,1,"Yay vincent animation buff

To be fair i think 300% animation would be too much, i would rather keep animation and increase his missle speed to no9 levels

 - his block windup could be better, current vincent is the only one where i think running teog would be almost not recommended, ran practice with two eog priests while im trying to find  comparisons for his dps, started with overdrive and switching to different skills, after the 7th L&amp;L i queued, did the 1st L&amp;L start, his animations and travel time are horriBad

 - dps heavily relies on block crits, so until the donkey-speed bullet hits we cant further make a decision whether we follow up with another block or let him continue further into his passive-crit followup

 - dps lost due to travel time

 - hard to tell if his passive procd or not

AskMen,1,0,1,"&gt; You know I hate this stereotype. Many people are in different situations in life. Not everyone on reddit is a no life homebody. Some people go out all the time, meet people and have no luck.

I never meant for it to sound like I was calling anyone a no-life, which is why I specifically didn't say it. I'm sorry it read that way. And trust me, I'm not *that* naive, I'm aware that there a lot of people struggling. Hell, I'm one of them. But there *is* a reason that this stereotype exists, and it's not just in the realm of men. Head on over to /r/AskWomen, you'll see that no matter you gender you could have the stereotype of someone who sits inside all day **watching netflix** *cough* and sitting on reddit. 

&gt;Also not everyone has had the same friend circle since they were 10 which seems the case for every other redditor.

Really, though? Because ***I*** beg to differ that that's the case. If anything that's the larger stereotype here. I have one or two friends that I've known since I was probably 4 or 5 years old, and I live very far away from my home town. I don't quite see how this has anything to do with the topic though, since frankly, lots of people decide to move away and they need to start over fresh, they just deal with it differently. Even I moved 2600km from my hometown 3 years ago, and yeah I'm struggling with meeting new people, but if I think about it, I haven't put in that much effort.

houston,5,0,5,"Realtor here; I encounter the same difficulties you are facing with my clients whether it's FHA, VA, or even Conventional loans. (One client even worked for the bank the loan was coming from). Most homes listed from $100k-250k (and priced right) are having multiple offers presented within 1-3 days of going on the market; most of which are cash offers. (who can also offer more than list price if necessary without worry of whether the home appraises for that price or not; which is required for any loan approval) Add to that the strict requirements a home must have to qualify for a VA or FHA loan, and that Conventional loan offers are being passed up, I can imagine your frustration. 
Unfortunately, it doesn't look like the tides are going to change any time soon, but I assure you that persistence pays off and if you do your homework, (knowing the ins and outs of the requirements for each loan) you can confidently put offers on homes and ease the concerns of a seller. Of course cash is king, so know that it is not just your VA type loan that is being passed over, it's most offers submitted requiring financing. (in this particular price range)
I know it is tough, but keep the faith.  Things will get better and your luck will turn, because ""luck"" is simply the intersection of opportunity and preparation. ",t3_36da5u,crd4k43,t3_36da5u,t1_crd4k43

Why should they pay you more to work for the same amount of time?

&gt; I tend to have more free time than those working during the day shift.

&gt; Sometimes there just isn't much for me to do at night.

&gt; I try to keep myself busy with anything I can

So they finally gave you a project to use the time they've been paying you for that you've been twiddling your thumbs, and you're upset because you don't really enjoy this aspect of what your job is now encompassing?

You could certainly ask for a raise, but make sure you are justified in doing so. Based on what you've posted (maybe too honest) you're filling your down time doing something your boss has asked you to do that you don't enjoy. They don't pay you to enjoy your job, they pay you case it needs to be done.

If it's within your ability to handle, then, me, as an employer, would expect you to handle it for the same amount of money as I was paying you before as clearly I didn't have enough on your plate previously and in a sense you owe me as an employer for all the time I paid you to sit around...

TL;DR - Yes you can ask for a raise, you are handling additional responsibility. Just be very cautious in how you approach it. I would also wait another month or two before asking to confirm if this is a permanent thing. Asking for a temporary raise to handle something in the same amount of hours is just weird to me and is something I would never do.",t3_36g3oy,crdor5n,t3_36g3oy,t1_crdor5n

Maybe non-consideration is the goal. But a person either already there, in which case they don't need a teaching, or they aren't, in which case they... need a teaching? Anything that leads to your ""non-consideration"" would *have* to be a consideration of something. Even a lesson that there is no lesson is a consideration.

mylittlepony,-2,0,-2,"&gt;It's not like every other episode is going to be filled with obtrusive brony references,

That's not what I'm afraid of. Firstly, they'll take away the fun of background characters. The background ponies were always blank templates for our own little stories and interpretations. Confirming anything about them takes away all the fun. Even if they nail it, watching the background and making little stories about it wont be as fun anymore.

Secondly, judging by how most fans handle them, they will likely be one-dimensional joke characters. So not only our own little characters will be replaced by something, it may be replaced by a joke. Every background occurrence will be a punchline of a very shitty joke. Every complex and witty little storyline will be replace with silly jokes. Sure you could make good stories about jokes too, but it will be limited to just jokes.

At the same time not three month ago a CDP employee claimed that the PC version would look like the footage from 2013 on ultra, a claim we now know without a shadow of a doubt to be false. CDP has refused to comment on the downgrade since then and has been actively suppressing information proving the downgrade on their forums. CDP has also refused to give out review codes for the PC version claiming the alleged importance of the day 1 patch for the experience, a patch that we now know doesn't do shit to restore any of the PC features showed in 2013. Not even Bioware has betrayed PC gamers that much, even the turd of Dragon Age 2 had a playable demo that let the people experience it's shittyness before buying.

Parenting,6,0,6,"When its just me and kid at home the TV is off as I never liked having it as background noise, but when my bloke is home he'll usually watch something. During the week my kid usually won't see the TV on at all as she plays outside after daycare until dinner time, and sometimes after as well. 

At the weekend she gets to watch cartoons while we doze for a bit longer and then she's usually out for most of the day anyway so no TV then but she'll usually watch a film with my bloke at some point in the weekend and we often watch Simpsons together on Sundays. 

I'm not keen on TV being on all the time as I think it can make you grow accustomed to having it as background noise which can make you then *need* it as background noise (I know a lot of people who say they need the TV on all day even if they're not watching as otherwise they feel weird). My bloke had a TV in his bedroom at a young age and got used to falling asleep watching telly and now he can't fall asleep without watching and/or listening to something on his phone.

CoonTown,3,0,3,"The thousands of photos I've seen show very few dead jews.  Most are also extremely skinny.  I find that quite odd personally.  So the Nazi's had them toiling (doing what) day in and day out only to gas them?  Then there's the fact that bones don't become entirely incinerated during the cremation process and would have to be dumped somewhere.  Some say they were dumped in the Rhine.  You would think the Nazi's would have kept records of that since they kept records of everything else.  

Of course then you have just the pure math behind it.   This was posted elsewhere. 

&gt;Average time to cremate a body--2 to 2.5 hours.
6 million x 2 = 12 million cremation hours.
12 million/24 = 500,000 cremation Days (Assuming 24 hour operations)
500,000/365 = 1,369 cremation years
WWII lasted 6 years.
1,369/6 = 228
To accomplish this there would have to be 228 incinerators running 24/7 burning bodies assuming jews were in camps with incinerators for the entire time (which they weren't).
Supposedly there were larger incinerators built but far too few and the numbers don't add given the times they supposedly ran.
http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/augas.html
In fact, they are just saying the bodies could be burned which is entirely different than a cremation process. From just the sheer lack of size in those pictures, I doubt that many bones could be incinerated daily.



Personally I don't know and I look forward to eaglezhigher's sources.  I can tell you this though.  I find it VERY troubling that in many nations it's illegal to question the holocaust.  That's the kind of thing you see in North Korea where they believe their leaders use to ride unicorns into battle and the government even created a fake historical find of a Unicorn lair.  You have to ask yourself why and quite frankly HOW these laws are put in place.  It is a powerful group that can put forth and pass legislation like this in multiple countries.",t3_36hc2u,crea7yd,t1_cre9pzz,t1_crea7yd

TumblrInAction,22,0,22,"Rant/Spoilers!

I *hated* Sansa in season 1. She sold her sister out, got her Direwolf killed, and was annoyingly single-minded in her quest to marry Joffrey. But she was also only like fuckin 12/13. (Tyrion asks her how old she is on their wedding night and she tells him she's 14) Is she as badass as her cynical, angry as fuck sister? No, but she was always been the proper lady she was raised to be. Good with needlework, quiet, obedient, well spoken, and just all of the general qualities you want a young Lady to have. She was also pretty fuckin naive, which isn't too hard to imagine when you think about how she was raised and how she spent her time and who with.

While she was in the castle doing Lady-like things, Arya was (disobediently) running around with the soldiers and knights, learning to fight and shoot, and probably overhearing stories of battle and war, off color jokes, and other harsh realities of the world while spending as much time around the men as possible, which shows how they are two completely different people. Which made Sansa pretty unrelatable, boring and annoying while Arya is everyone's favorite. (Mine included)

Then you've got the death of Ned, and Sansa literally is stuck in King's Landing, hating the Lannisters with every ounce of her being and being surrounded by people that hate every ounce of her being. Except Joffrey, until he sees Margery anyway, but he's a sick fuck anyway and no one wants that kinda love. You add the Red Wedding to the list of happenings, and Sansa is totally alone in King's Landing just trying to stay alive. She knows she fucked up, but can't do anything to help it. All she can do is what everyone tells her to do, lest she be killed. Her only ally is Littlefinger, who she trusts because there's no one else to trust.

By the time she meets Brienne she's been alone for so long, she's too wary of everyone else so she chooses not to trust her and continues on with LF. Fast forward to her marriage to Ramsay, and as she's stepping toward her new fate you can see she's so pissed at herself for not just going with that giant fuckin blonde lady and her curiously sexy squire. Oh, and all the while Sansa is still a teenager.

TL;DR: I also hated Sansa, but she's been in so many fucked up situations, not all her fault, and is still just a teenager with a high born Lady upbringing, which stunted her ability to see the world for how fucked up it is. At this point she's disproportionately reaping what she didn't really mean to sow in the first place, and I feel bad for her now.",t3_36hqg6,creabeg,t1_cre4svp,t1_creabeg

The other thing to note about how technology can determine which hotels thrive and those that don't is the experience. Hotels that offer free Wifi, interact with their customers on social media, provide interoperability with personal electronic devices, dynamically adjust rates based on availability and market forces, service automation etc will gradually take over. Especially as people get used to more gadgets and technology in their homes, they will expect the same if not more in hotels.

The disruptive technologies of VR and 3D printing will also have an impact for the hotel industry in the future. Most hotel websites already include a virtual tour of the rooms and facilities and that will expand to let you navigate in a fully realised VR environment. Room customisations using 3D printed furniture could also be an added value that would differentiate hotels that have embraced technology and I know as a consumer that would be useful for me.

ABraThatFits,2,0,2,"Ah okay, so the main issue is likely projection. None of these bras are going to be projected enough for you, I don't think. What's happening is that your breasts need a lot of space right at the wire and since these bras don't have that space, your breasts push the whole bra down because they're looking for more room which is at the apex. Because of this, no matter how tight the band or straps are, it will be a shape mismatch. Typically those with quite projected breasts don't get along great with any molded options that aren't from Poland, unfortunately. It's the nature of the beast. 

Also, the calculator we use here spits out suggested UK sizes. Natori uses US sizing and Chantelle uses French sizing. The Natori you got (in 32G) is equivalent to a UK 32F, and the Chantelle (in 32F) is equivalent to a UK 32E. So, just keep that in mind going forward. It sounds like you've figured out that the UK 32F is a better match for you, volume-wise. 

I know unlined bras can be a little bit out of the comfort zone for some people, but I think you would fare well in either Panache Jasmine or Envy. Panache tends to run *fairly* firm, so I'd suggest trying a 34E and a 32F in them if you can. They're usually available on Amazon Prime if you want to get in on free shipping and returns, though it looks like they're retailing there at full price right now. These bras are great for projection right at the wire and they both have a stretchy upper lace section that can compensate for any size changes during the month and lowers the risk of quadboob/minor shape weirdness. Both of these bras should also do a better job of pushing your boobs more front and center and less east/west. ",t3_36itf2,crenn3y,t1_cremtl4,t1_crenn3y

Flat earth evidence is so strong, you just have to look.  There are lots of resources available at the site I linked.  There are physical experiments you can do yourself to prove it to yourself.   

Once you have examined the physical evidence of the flat earth, then move on to the how and why.  Rejecting something that is physically provable because of the magnitude of the implications of its truth is just willful blindness.

Also, the motive for the moon landing, and other NASA adventures is partially about covering up the flatness of our earth.

They can through permitting, liscencing etc make sure that the access to a mineral owners oil doesn't encroach on someone elsee rights as well so there are ways to control this but an outright ban should end up losing.  There are a couple Colorado towns which I think have been successful in banning fracking and have not likely been challenged because theres not likely a mineral owner in the town with enough minerals to make it worth while.  Most lots in my town are .3 to .5 acres and to spend the kind of money necessary to prevail on something like this we better be talking thousands of acres in many units otherwise the cost benefit just doesn't work especially when there are other places with accessable oil and less burdensome leasing programs required to access it.

atheism,1,0,1,"I think we do ask what it is for. But sometimes, in order to fully understand something you need to understand the components that it is made of. Personally, I know what my PC is for, what use it has, but I am insterested in knowing how the different parts are made and put together, so I can know how to better use and utilize my PC. If you close your eyes to how things have come into existense you exlude yourself from acquiring a deeper knowledge. If you are only interested in the use of a certain object, you will never know how somebody made the object useful. 

To me, and it may seem harsh, this is exactly what religion is about. Closing your eyes to knowledge on a deeper level, and just accepting a ""holy"" book for face value, accepting that ""this books says so, so I don't need to know what the background for anything is"". I think it is a shame really, because there are so much knowledge out there that you are excluding yourself from, on the foundation of a book. To me, the goal of my life will always be to acquire as much knowledge as I can, to challenge my own habits and my thoughts. Even the things I think I know, when presented with evidence for the opposite, I search and read and try to find as much as I can about it, because perhaps I am not right after all, so I look for new background information so I can make a new assesment of my own knowledge.

When you know the use of a cup, you don't have to ask again for the next cup you find. When you find out the use for a pencil you don't have to investigate again when you pick a new one up.

golf,1,0,1,"It was really great! It was very informal and lots of good questions. There was about 30 people there. Michael was probably the most articulate, Rory was more brash and sarcastic (surprise, surprise), and Tony was just chill and smiling a lot. I'll try to relate a few of their answers:

**What do you do for diet and workout?**

Michael and Tony said they workout, but not a ton. They made reference to the fact that you are walking 8-10 miles a day. They looked to be in good shape. Rory said he doesn't do anything and is very tired at the end of the day. He's 39. He gave Tony a hard time for being young. They all made reference to Tony's distance, but said that the biggest thing is not to workout for power but rather for longevity of career - being able to play at a high level for a long time. They all embraced the fact that they all start the year at the same level, and you have to play well to succeed.

**What do you miss by watching golf on TV?**

Biggest thing is the banter between the player and the caddy. It's often raunchy or terrible, and its meant to keep the player out of his own head. Caddy's that are the best are the ones that aren't afraid to hurt their player's feelings or worry about losing their jobs, but rather speak plainly. Some players don't want their caddy's to say anything. Its just very different types of people.

Also they mentioned that if you watch golf on TV, you are missing the VAST majority of players. Surprisingly, the Tour is not just Phil, Tiger, Jordan, and a few others.

**How many tournaments do you play per year?**

Between 25 and 30, but it really depends on your card status, the money list, and health. They covet the weeks off, especially multiple weeks in a row.

**What do you do on your off times?**

First few days - nothing. Just sleep and hang out. Watch movies. Michael was saying that he loves working on old cars and has a few project ones that he's restoring. Pretty cool!",t3_36mooq,crfh7z8,t1_crfel68,t1_crfh7z8

Music,1,0,1,"Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/introduction). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

If you play chord one afeter each other, keeping all notes from the following chord in the harmonic of the note from the first code can be too strict.

* Fire ants (9 out of 10 would rather be set on fire than swarmed by these)

**Deadly Mammals:**

* Kangaroos (they can kickbox better than most UFC competitors)
* Dropbears

**Deadly Trees:**

* Gympie Gympie (YES we have a TREE that will try to kill you. A TREE. Not a moving animal/insect/whatever, but a stationary TREE will murder you)

**Deadly in water:**

* Box jellyfish
* Irukandji jellyfish
* Bluebottle jellyfish
* Common lionfish
* Blue-ringed octopus
* Cone shells (YES a shell will kill you)
* Stonefish (pretends to be a stone, then kills you)
* Smooth toadfish

These are just the ones that use chemical warefare to hurt/main/kill you, or use nice sharp teeth to inflict the same damage. We have others that I have missed that will kill you via conventional means as well.

Criteriile pentru adoptie sunt oricum destul de riguroase, ceea ce asigura faptul ca un copil va locui cu adulti responsabili care isi permit sa il ingrijeasca si sa-i ofere o educatie. Sunt cele mai de baza criterii, pe care unii parinti hetero nu le indeplinesc din cauza faptului ca pot concepe copii si din greseala.

leagueoflegends,35,0,35,"For those at work:

""Today Winterfox would like to announce our new roster for the 2015 North American Challenger Series Summer Split. After a heartbreaking defeat against Team Dragon Knights in the promotional tournament, we've been tasked with rebuilding from the ground up.

Winterfox has parted ways with the majority of its starting roster. Helios and Gleeb have chosen to pursue other opportunities, Altec will be playing for Gravity, and Pobelter taking over the mid lane for CLG. We wish everyone the best of luck with their new ventures in life and appreciate all the time they gave our organization.

Switching from substitutes to starting positions we have Ryan “ShorterACE” Nget filling the role of jungler and Kenneth “ExecutionerKen” Tang moving up to starting support. Donghyeon “Avalon” Shin will return as our starting top laner. Rounding out the roster will be two new faces to the Winterfox pack: Lyonel “Arcsecond” Pfaender will join our team as the starting midlaner, coming off an impressive performance with TSM darkness, and Kristoffer “P1noy” Albao Lund Pedersen, formerly of Gambit Gaming, will be our new starting ADC.

We have collected a team of positive, outgoing and talented players that we believe will come together and form a strong bond both as teammates and friends. Our players are no stranger to the LCS, and we have faith that their abilities and experience will fulfill our ambitions of regaining our place in the top 10.

Head Coach ElderPeko has this to add: ""I have a lot of confidence in our new roster. I feel that I am more than capable in helping these players achieve great things. People may be skeptical of the situation, but I can assure them that this was the correct decision. In our time since relegation we have put together a strong pack of young, talented players. I am looking forward to helping them grow in a productive and positive environment, not only as players, but as individuals.”

As an organization we will also be working hard to bring you regular in-house content that documents our road back to the LCS. We know that keeping our fans up-to-date is important, and we're excited to let you in on what goes on behind the scenes. The players will be heading to the house in the next few weeks, so look forward to more news and content as they arrive.

Last of all, thank you to all our fans for your continued support. We know it's been a tough split, but we're not giving up! Knowing you're there for us makes the comeback that much easier. ‪#‎WFXPRIDE‬""",t3_36rrp9,crghofq,t3_36rrp9,t1_crghofq

todayilearned,15,0,15,"&gt;The ""E.185"" or ""Compound Deltic"" turbo-compound variant was planned[1] and a single prototype was built in 1956[10] and tested in 1957.[11] This capitalised on Napier's experience with both the ""Nomad"", and its increasing involvement with gas turbines. It used the Deltic as the gas generator inside a gas turbine, with both a twelve-stage axial compressor and a three-stage gas turbine. Unlike the Nomad, this turbine was not mechanically coupled to the crankshaft, but merely drove the compressor. It was hoped that it would produce 6,000 horsepower,[citation needed] with fuel economy and power-to-weight ratio ""second to none"".[12] Predictions by the engineers closely connected with it were that connecting rod failure would be the limit on this power, failing at around 5,300 bhp. **On test it actually produced 5,600 bhp before throwing a connecting rod through the crankcase just as predicted.**[10]

worldnews,3,0,3,"No worries. So your stop loss is at 75%, meaning the point at which you have lost 75% of **your** value. The 625% is pretty much irrelevant at this point, because it is all past gains. From your perspective as an investor, the stock is currently at a 0% gain or loss from when you entered, and you are starting your short at stock price X.

So, just say that the stock costs $100 per share, and was previously worth $16 per share a year ago. This means the stock has gone up 625% over one year. You now plan on shorting the stock. Although you know that the stock went up 625% previously, you had nothing to do with it because you did not own the stock during the rise. 

So, when you short, you borrow a share from a broker. You then sell that share for $100. You now are +$100 and you are in debt 1 share of stock to the broker. Now just say the next day the market hypes up and the stock jumps to $175 (this would almost never happen, but neither would a 75% stop loss). You have now hit your stop loss and you now need to return the share to the broker. You purchase the share for $175 and then give it to the broker. So, +100-175 = -75. Your ""equity"" was originally worth $100, and now it is worth $25. You lost 75% of your money.

So, what was the thing we ignored the entire time? The 625% gain! There could be perfectly reasonable explanations as to why this happened, and without a much more detailed look into the stock I don't think anyone on here is really right in criticizing investors, who probably know a lot more than they do about why it happened. In terms of stop losses, shorts present the potential for unlimited loss (just say the equity went up to $250 - you are now at +100-250 = -150, so you not only have lost all of your equity you have now gone 50 into ""debt""). So, while you may think you can have a great plan in shorting stocks that go up a ton, there really isn't a ton of evidence to suggest that you consistently gain money doing so. And, if your stop loss is at 75%, your massive losses on your poor choices will easily outweigh any correct shorts you make. ",t3_36qx4j,crglqre,t1_crgl9so,t1_crglqre

Superior martial artists?  Superior detectives?  Superior strategists?  Batman is clearly described as a *master* of all of these things, and they are all broad reaching.

*Good* at everything doesn't come close....  Batman is *VERY GOOD* at everything, and in select areas there are a few characters who surpass him in very specific tasks.

I simply find a character that good at all things dull.  There's nothing we've ever seen batman be bad at.

&gt; Heck, half the reason he can beat the Joker is that the Joker lets him.

Notably, half the time I find the Joker a more compelling and fascinating character than Batman.

&gt; And his faults aren't his virtues.

I disagree.  Nearly all his faults are somehow linked to him being a better crimefighter/hero.  Being unpleasant company doesn't exactly balance out the character, especially when plenty of versions of Batman portray Bruce as masterfully charismatic as well.

&gt; He's suffered, emotionally and physically, in crime-fighting life and non-crimefighting life, for his faults.

This is hardly a fault...  In my eyes this only builds him up as a martyr.  Behold how Batman has suffered so that he might save you from super super villains!",t3_36qujy,crgndae,t1_crgmd99,t1_crgndae

DIY,1,0,1,"I have an older Jeep Wranger that has rust spots on the front wheel wells.  I could pay a ton to replace both fenders, but I only drive it occasionally, and when I do it's for trail riding.  So, here's what I did to ""fix"" the rust:

1. I got some steel wool (the kind that doesn't have soap integrated in the pad...just plain steel wool), scouring pads (the green ones), CLR (you can get it at Home Dept or Walmart) and a good auto wax.

2. The first thing I did was scrub the affected area with the steel wool (removing any/all visible signs of rust).  This step took the longest, as I wanted to make sure to get rid of any trace of rust.

3. I sprayed the area (really, I soaked it) with the CLR.  I left it alone for about 30 minutes.  This was to get any rust I wasn't able to see.  After thirty minutes, I used some shop rags to completely dry the area.

4. I went back with the scouring pads (using Acetone) and scoured the entire area.  You could probably skip this part, but I wanted to make sure there was nothing remaining before applying the wax.

5. I applied a liberal coat of wax and buffed.  You could also use a spray primer (if it's in an area that isn't visible, or you don't mind the look).  

I try to reapply the wax every couple of months.  So far, it's been about a year and no rust has reappeared.  I tell myself that someday I'll replace the fenders, but in the meantime this method works and keeps me from spending a couple of grand.",t3_36sddm,crguevr,t1_crgsl9q,t1_crguevr

It's true you can point to many examples where the judiciary has failed to protect individual rights.  However, you can also point to many more examples where they have.

With regards to the Fourth Amendment, the courts have not squarely ruled on the constitutionality of warrantless wiretapping.  Challenges to programs like these take time to work their way through the system.

There may be different methods of time travel which involved different consequences.  Barry's method of time travel in the finale was different than that of what happened earlier in the season.

For instance, earlier in the season Dr. Wells tells Barry that he ruptured the time continuum.  That is different than creating a worm hole.  With a worm hole, there is a constant connection to the past time from the future.  There was no constant connection for Barry when he time traveled earlier in the season.

Also, here's the problem with discussing time travel at all: it is fiction.  All we know of time travel is theories that people have.  You can't call a show's description of time travel wrong or inaccurate because we don't know how it would actually work.",t3_36qrhw,crgz5tn,t3_36qrhw,t1_crgz5tn

math,1,0,1,"They theorize that people whose upbringing was under the Russian language have a tendency to have a mind that is naturally better adapted at grasping mathematical concepts. They think this is because of Russian's absence of articles (a, the), and so that affects the form in which ideas are understood by their brains. So they get benefit from it toward math ideas.

The question is: If we were to create a *new* human language, from scratch, to raise some math-bound children in, with the goal of having their minds be even more well-adept at math-grasping, what characteristics should we include into that language that we'll be raising them on?

AskReddit,2,0,2,"I don't recall, thought it was Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol.

This article describes some of the details --
http://www.history.org/Foundation/journal/Winter10/jefferson.cfm

&gt; What Jefferson termed his coup de grace was delivered on a loan he cosigned for longtime friend Wilson Cary Nicholas. The amount was large, two notes at $10,000 each, but Jefferson felt obligated. As president of the United States bank in Richmond, Nicholas had arranged and endorsed notes for Jefferson, and he was connected to the family as the father-in-law of grandson Jeff Randolph. Nichols died in October 1820, and his estate, valued at $350,000 when Jefferson had signed his notes in 1818, was now greatly depreciated as well as heavily mortgaged. Jefferson had to add the $20,000 note with $1,200 yearly interest to his own sizable debt.

&gt; A severe devaluation of Virginia land prices had troubled Jefferson even before Nicholas’s death, when he had tried his usual fallback of a sale of a small parcel of land to cover an interest payment. In a letter to trusted friend James Madison he laid bare his financial problems and theorized that the current economic situation in Virginia had “peopled the Western States, by silently breaking up those on the Atlantic, and glutted the land market, while it drew off its bidders.”

&gt; Did he realize that one of the most significant accomplishments of his presidency, the Louisiana Purchase, had accelerated the depreciation of land in Virginia? It was not so much the addition of territory beyond the Mississippi River as the acquisition of the port of New Orleans that had been Jefferson’s main objective. United States control of the port city guaranteed that American commerce produced in the trans-Appalachian regions would have an outlet to world markets. This made a move west potentially more profitable, and the fatigued land of Virginia less attractive.",t3_36m3ed,crhe9bv,t1_crgnwqa,t1_crhe9bv

todayilearned,3,0,3,"&gt; Just because I know that my child is going to choose to lie to me does not mean I made him lie. He choose to do it.

Except you never actually *know* they are going to do something.  To know it means there is no other possibility.  What you mean about your kids is that you ""think"" they are going to do something or that you are ""pretty sure"" they will.  The difference is massive since the whole point of the question is that there is only one possibility of what you will do.  If there is only one thing you can possibly do then you can have the *illusion* of free will but you can not have actual free will.

If you ""know"" your child is going to lie about something, they might still surprise you (it is possible).  But if an omniscient god knows you are going to, say, steal a candy bar, then there is no set of circumstances or choice or idea or concept or situation in which you are not going to eventually steal the candy bar.  If you have no choice but to steal the candy bar, then you, by definition, lack any actual free will.

photography,3,0,3,"Just because a photograph is not a physical product does not mean that it does not have value and these photographs are being turned into physical products. Photographs can be worth thousands of dollars. Just look at this guy, selling stolen photos for $90,000. That is more than most peoples cars!

This is real life. It is happening to real people, and having impact upon their lives when they find out what is happening. Hell, it might even be impacting upon their lives and business before they even know what is happening. Just because it is on Instagram does not mean its suddenly not ""real life"".

When you share a photograph on the internet, you know there is a risk it may be shared elsewhere on the internet. But when you post something onto Instagram, or Flickr or whatever you are agreeing that it can be viewed on those platforms and shared by linking to said platform. You are not agreeing to someone stealing your photograph and profiting from it.

The internet is not a ""no rights land"". Everyone has rights on the internet, its just that people think it is okay to break them. There are copyright laws and many other internet related laws for a reason. Just look at the UK, here we have people being arrested for posting jokes on Twitter which people find offensive. The internet may of started off as a kind of no-mans land, with no one ruling it but these days, there are rules and they are getting stricter every day.

You will be arrested or sued if you download music etc illegally. You can be sued for stealing photographs. It is more of a civil offense, but it is still an offense.

I think you should follow your own advice, and look at your view points. Put yourself in the shoes of someone who is working as a photographer and suddenly finds their photographs are being sold for thousand and you're not getting a cut. ",t3_36vy92,cri0ybu,t1_crhs2jv,t1_cri0ybu

That being said: as far as I know, there are very few police helicopters in Alaska -- last time I heard anything, I was under the impression that AST has the only one(s) and they are based out of Anchorage.

The last time I heard about cops using a helicopter was when one crashed in 2014 and killed everyone on board in white-out weather conditions.

The only time I can recall hearing about SERT using a helicopter for an operation was in 1984 when they were hunting a serial killer -- that ended with SERT member [Troy Duncan](http://www.odmp.org/officer/4362-trooper-troy-lynn-duncan)  and the suspect both killed when they exchanged gun-fire from the helicopter.

CoonTown,9,0,9,"Go ahead. Insult me. Just say something factual after it, or you'll look stupid. Here's my evidence pal. I have more. 

Blacks are admixed with an archaic human species.

&gt;**And there were further surprises from a specimen that I and collaborators published on a few months ago. It's the oldest fossil from Nigeria, from a site called Iwo Eleru. It's about 13,000 years old, and yet if you look at it, you would say from its shape that it's more than 100,000 years old. This reminds us that we have a very biased picture of African evolution, with many unknown areas, and there could be relics of human evolution hanging on not only outside of Africa in the form of the Neanderthals and the Denisovans, and over in Flores, this strange creature nicknamed the 'Hobbit'.** In Africa itself, archaic humans could have lingered in parts of the continent as well. From some recent genetic analyses, there is evidence of an input of archaic DNA into some modern African populations as recently as 35,000 years ago. So even in Africa, the process was more complicated than we thought.

http://edge.org/conversation/rethinking-out-of-africa

Obviously, there is archaic admixture in negros.

&gt;**Analysis suggests genetic mixing occurred in Africa around 35,000 years ago.**

http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110905/full/news.2011.518.html

Europeans have been in Europe for 36 thousand years.

&gt;Here we use DNA sequence data gathered from 61 noncoding autosomal regions in a sample of three sub-Saharan African populations (Mandenka, Biaka, and San) to test models of African archaic admixture. **We use two complementary approximate-likelihood approaches and a model of human evolution that involves recent population structure, with and without gene flow from an archaic population. Extensive simulation results reject the null model of no admixture and allow us to infer that contemporary African populations contain a small proportion of genetic material (≈2%) that introgressed ≈35 kya from an archaic population that split from the ancestors of anatomically modern humans ≈700 kya**........Taken together our results suggest that polymorphisms present in extant populations introgressed via relatively recent interbreeding with hominin forms that diverged from the ancestors of modern humans in the Lower-Middle Pleistocene.

WorldofTanks,10,0,10,"Nothing much has change in the last year, beyond a few new tanks and a bunch of rebalanced tanks. Accuracy was slightly changed (overall it was a significant improvement), a few new maps were added (which are all pretty good), they've added personal missions, and they've started pulling premium tanks from the shops.

Personal missions are divided into four levels with 75 missions each, 15 for each tank class. Each mission pays fairly well, is not repeatable, varies in difficulty (some are stupidly easy, some are very hard) and has a bonus objective for additional prizes. They have to be completed in order, so you have to do SPG-12 after SPG-4, but you can do MT-5 before HT-2, and completing the 15th mission nets you 4 or 5 ""tokens"", depending on whether you get the bonus objective. It also nets you a female crew member that you can train to any role in any tank, which comes with a special ""Sisterhood of Steel"" 0th perk that is the same as Brothers in Arms but is not compatible. When you get 20 ""tokens"" you get a special premium tank. They are surprisingly difficult to get and very few have completed them.

For premium tanks, the new tanks are significantly cheaper, do NOT have limited MM, and are actually pretty good. As far as removals, the TOG II* and E 25 were the worst losses - the former will still be a regular reward tank and occasionally be sold, the latter is passing into legends like the Type 59. They've also pulled the FCM 36 Pak 40, T14, and Panther/M10, and will be pulling four more tanks in the next month.

The new French tier 10 med is very good, the British TD line is very fun but the tier 10 is a major letdown, the American lights (a continuation of the Chaffee line) are godlike, the Russian lights are solid, and the German tier 8 light is incredible. TDs no longer have OP view range, and scouts as a whole have been buffed significantly.",t3_36ye9l,cri6avp,t3_36ye9l,t1_cri6avp

Second, I'm not even saying not to develop coal if it is the only means to pull themselves up.

All I'm saying is that the attitude of ""Well you are doing this bad thing so I should be able to too"" is childish. If you're going to pollute, at least know the risk, own it, and accept the fact that eventually everyone will have to move to renewables.

I just don't get why they would want to go down our same steps, knowing the problems we face. They have the advantage of hindsight, and can see that the rest of the world is approaching an energy crisis, so to build up using the same type of energy seems silly.

In the US we haven't a huge infrastructure built around shitty energy already including our gas guzzling vehicles. We are going to go through a crisis that forces us to change our infrastructure eventually, but other countries who developed recently might stand a chance to avoid that fate. Like the countries who chose to make their vehicles run on different sources of fuel, they are better off for it in the long run.

Or course they need to develop enough to get out of poverty, but it's just as important to ensure their future is renewable so they aren't stuck using antiquated sources of energy.",t3_36y5ms,crid9b0,t1_crid1ez,t1_crid9b0

horror,6,0,6,"I owe a bit to this film because it inadvertently got me into foreign film. First of course by prompting me to watch the original which then opened me up to foreign cinema and discovering some of my favourite films and directors today. 

The film on its own merit I still think is special. It came at a time when not a whole lot was happening in the genre and its success helped reboot (well maybe the original gets credit for that) and open up English audiences to J-style horror. 

It’s also the only movie that has ever really creeped me out. I was 15 when I saw it at the cinemas and Samara has given me reoccurring nightmares ever since. I think something should also be said about how the film (well, both films) manages to take the T.V. - an object of entertainment in every household and turn it into frightful device. I'm ashamed to admit that even at the age of 15 I was nervous for a few weeks to sleep in the same room as one. 

So I hold a special place for this film. Not just based on its own merit, but also because of how it influenced my taste in film as a teenager and perhaps also because of a little bit of nostalgia. ",t3_36z3u9,criezx5,t3_36z3u9,t1_criezx5

boston,0,0,0,"That link focused on why individual cities fail at this (because they completely half-ass it and worry about registration as a means of revenue instead of an educational licensing approach. Revenue revenue revenue.).  Honolulu actually got serious about it and it starts at the point of sale, just like with autos and motorbikes, and low and behold they crushed it, which brings me to my next point. 

The DMV/RMV is statewide and is the entity that should be regulating this.  They have the means to maintain the documentation database and provide education and testing, which is honestly the only legitimate problem in all those failed programs.  The programs were started by idiots as a means to rake in cash for their city, not create safety, and no one addressed problems as they arose because that would cost even more money.  Brilliant.

Why should this be a municipal ordinance?  It's so idiotic.  That would be like scrapping the whole idea of motor vehicle licensing because Albuquerque sucked at it.

The failed programs failed because they were half assed money grabs that no one put any actual thought into.

Bitcoin,20,0,20,"Ok, so at the time of writing the chain is 10 blocks long. There was a single transaction in each block, saying who solved it. Here's the ordered transaction history of block solvers we get from the chandler-chain:




Block  | Solver
------|------
1|KoKansei 
2|shludvigsen
3|veqtrus
4|werwiewas
5|lentil-soup
6|odal_limbs
7|snarklasers
8|guosim
9|ididntsaygoyet
10|100acrewood

So what's the use of this ? Firstly we know and can prove the blocks were solved in this order - anyone can trace back through the previous hashes in each block and verify the solutions even  if they only had the blocks themselves and could not see the reddit comments or timestamps.

It's important to know some things about the hashes themselves. No matter what data or how much data you put in a block, the hash will always be the same length, it will be seemingly random and it cannot be predicted. The only way to find a solution for a block that gives a specific pattern of hash and wins the game is by trial and error - there are no shortcuts. Changing any character in a block will change the answer hash, making the solution invalid. 

This has a couple of neat consequences: we can regulate the rate blocks are solved (regardless of how many people are trying) by making the necessary answer hash more specific. Block 2 only needed any hash starting with a 0 - easy  it was solved quickly. Block 10 needed one starting with two 0s - it took longer to find a solution. Here's a recent hash from a real bitcoin block, how much work do you think you need to do making random guesses to find this with 17 leading 0s:

&gt; 0000000000000000054528a0d64c4e3476e1685a12db24716c562a6d308ab1ff

Secondly, it means that work is needed to make every block, and this means that if someone wanted to corrupt the chain - to change history - for example to say peter123 solved block 2 instead of shludvigsen they would need to find a new solution for that block AND every block after it as the ""previous"" value in each block would change making their current solutions invalid. 

If everyone takes the longest chain as the correct record of history, and there is lots of work being done to mine that chain making it longer all the time, we end up with a secure incorruptible history of blocks.

One additional thing, at the time block 5 was mined, it was impossible to predict who would solve block 8 or what the hash would be. On something as large as the bitcoin blockchain with massive amounts of work needed to solve each block, deciding in advance to use the hash of a specific future block as a random number gives a provably fair random number. /r/millionairemakers is using this to pick their winners.

chandler-chain demonstrates the idea of a block-chain and shows how hashing and mining works. It's obviously not a full crypto-currency though as it's missing other aspects such blocks being shared among distributed nodes, automated block creation and verification (we were doing it by hand) and it doesn't have it's own native token - I was tipping block rewards manually via changetip. The public/private key transaction mechanism is completely missing from chandler-chain.

I wasn't denying that people might object from a plot or narrative standpoint, but I also think it's silly to deny that there is a decently sized contingent of people whose objections began and ended with the depiction of rape being unacceptable.

As for the article, I disagree with the author on several counts. Without diving too much in to personal history, I don't believe that the author's view of the consequences of rape are a foregone conclusion. It is never a good thing, but the ways to which people move forward vary. I also think that rape should not be off limits as a plot device every bit as much as I believe that deaths to gunfire or explosions should not be off limits in fiction, despite the fact that there are people who continue to suffer from the consequences of those. And mind you, I think that there are other ways D&amp;D could have handled the scene in ways that could have still been true to the characters.

I've seen other games (currently The Elder Scrolls Online) with similar forum policies fall to pieces when coupled with the developer's seeming lack of involvement. Right now in ESO, there are quite a few issues in PvP play that crappy people can exploit. So far Zenimax Online Studios hasn't had the balls to swing the banhammer in any sort of meaningful way (let alone fix them, citing prep for console launch). At the same time, ZOS has a policy of ""no naming and shaming"" on the official forums. A policy by which players attempting to voice legitimate concerns have been suspended from the forums because they could not tiptoe carefully enough while trying to inform other players of malicious actions. This combination of variables has led to a landscape of zero consequence for those who choose to break the rules.",t3_36yb5v,crikwzc,t1_crik9o4,t1_crikwzc

atheism,3,0,3,"Depends on the state.  Some places, the teacher will simply avoid it due to students who have been trained to disrupt any class where evolution is discussed.

Some places, teachers who do try to remain fact-based lose their jobs.  

You might think it's a set of individual isolated cases, but then consider that Texas is trying to get faith-based theories of the origin of life into textbooks.  Now you could say that that's just Texas continuing to go full retard, but the problem is that Texas is such a big market for textbooks that things that the yahoos want in their books get in there, and as a result other schools that buy the book get that stuff too.

I understand both of these as I grew up hunting. My view now is that an animal's interest in continuing living however it is going to live is greater than that pleasure. Especially, as I can reproduce so much of that pleasure other ways. Like you I love hiking and getting outdoors with friends and family.

Sometimes we have a hard time distinguishing between our pain. And how we deal with it. When ever I see some one who treats their children in a similar way mine treated me, I want to jump right in. I just don't though. I don't know what actually is going on, but I offer advice when asked in how to deal with things, by people who did go through what I did. 

Other people may not do that though. They feel any similarities to their parents are abuse and they have to help and or save them before they get hurt. 

It all really depends on the person who reads the post that's up there. Part of that subreddit is to assume everything has a type of abuse to it, which a lot of it does. It does help to get it out as well. They also suggest counseling to those who have been severely hurt. They're basically a support group, who want every one to feel like they have an ear. We worry about the longer members and try hard to make people consider talking about their issues. Do we have people with their quirks who have never had a thing wrong with them? Of course, but that doesn't mean they don't get to vent. To me it's a very supportive sub. I'm happy to be a part of it. Through the bad and the good.

ADHD,1,0,1,"I love that strategy you have set up for yourself!  As for the vacations/breaks I think XR is a pain to take breaks on.  I currently take IR specifically for that reason.  IR is great because if I only need it for 1 part of the day then I can only take 1 of the 2 doses (rather where XR is 2) or on days off take 0.  I think over time it does take a while to get use to the come downs and the difference between IR and XR are up to you.  Some people enjoy one more than the other!  I honestly enjoy both, but it personally sucks taking breaks on XR.  However there is a method to open the capsule up and distribute the beads to create IR doses too! (So that's an option)

My idea/finished ratio varies.  I can say I would've never made it through college (Animation major) without realizing my ADHD has been negatively affecting my life since I was about 6.  Failed elementary, middle school and barley passed high school.  But I graduated college and I have a full time job along with being independently contracted with 2 studios!  So Adderall has helped me A LOT.  

But as for the ratio, I would say it's pretty great!  Overall it varies.  If I'm off meds and there's no work to do then I relax and get creative.  If I have a lot to work with no meds then I get anxious, depressed and not motivated.  On medication it's completely different.  I'm also more social on it took so making connections is a breeze.",t3_371slk,crj42pg,t1_crj1wkx,t1_crj42pg

Uncharted 2 was pretty impressive. I was impressed with my PS3 and my 8800 GTS was better in some cases but the PS3 was better in others. 

Menwhile PS4 came later 2013 early 2014. Same year as the 700 series from nvidia alreay the 770 beat the PS4. One gen later the 970 wreck the PS4 like a twig. 

With VR on the rise requiring 1080p locked 90 fps and motion tracking how can they compete?

Whats gonna happen next gen when DX12/Vulcan optimized architecture come out rocking HMB ram and whatever nvidia comes up with. What happens when PCs switch to DDR4? When Skylake and Zen come along? 3 year in the and Consoles seem obsolete.

smashbros,3,0,3,"This is actually a big problem for me, but strangely, only at smash tournaments.

I think I've figured out why I become so bad socially, but I've yet to figure out how to get past it.

1) Most of the time I'm playing friendlies, I'm concentrating on the game, and I can't really talk without my play going downhill. 

2) On top of this, making less than a minute of eye contact with someone during a set, makes it difficult for me to expect people to remember who I am.

3) My city has no smash scene, I travel to all events, and always feel like an outsider. I figure that people I spend the most time with and feel closest too, have probably spent multiple amounts of that time with people in their own city.

On top of all this, I was pretty much sick for an entire year and didn't really didn't socialise with people at all during that time, and I feel like my desire to be socialise has gone down a lot as a result. I was also diagnosed with anxiety, depression and aspergers syndrome as a child, so some remnants of that may still be around, though they're not on any significant level.

Oh, and I find myself thinking that everyone hates me, but I tell myself that's probably irrational thinking, as I haven't actually done anything hate worthy imo. People get salty over smash, but that's a fact nobody can do anything about. It's much more likely they don't care/don't remember the things you're thinking about.

Long comment, but I guess the take away is, you're probably not alone in feeling anxious around people, for whatever reason. Treating the issue to be a big deal will probably make it worse, so just push it to the back of your mind, and do your best :). If it's affecting you that badly go for treatment, but I personally have found therapy to be non-beneficial, ymmv.",t3_371v7u,crj963h,t3_371v7u,t1_crj963h

ftlgame,6,0,6,"I played a good deal of DCSS some years ago. The original game had two ""extreme"" races: the mummy and the ghoul.   They messed with the food clock, one of the core mechanics of Linley's Dungeon Crawl. Especially with the mummy, you're basically opting out of a core element of the game.

But every race the DCSS team added, was an extreme class. First the vampire, which stuck to Linley's theme of the undead being the offbeat choice with food issues. But then the Deep Dwarves, with no regen, the cat people with multiple lives but very limited gear, the octopus people whose gimmick is 8 ring slots. They also kept deleting those races which were distinguished merely by aptitude differences.

Of course as any min maxer can tell you, picking an extreme disadvantage with an extreme advantage can be great, as long as you have a way to nullify the disadvantage. That's what extreme race games are all about. DCSS, like most open source games, is developed by its most dedicated fans, who love that sort of thing. But that is basically because they're tired of the base game! For all their  dedication to follow Linley's design philosophy, they found a way to mess it up. I thought that if they really wanted those races, they should put them behind an unlock, or even in a mod. Because they were, like the mummy, often counterproductive in learning how to play the game.

By comparison, you still play the same game in FTL with all the ships. You would benefit from having them all unlocked in learning to play the game, but they aren't so hard to unlock that it slows you down appreciably. I think a far more questionable design decision for a roguelike is the difficulty levels - DCSS does that better with its ""push your luck"" extended endgame in my opinion.",t3_37354e,crjeye7,t3_37354e,t1_crjeye7

worldpolitics,-8,0,-8,"Corporate media is lying to us about just about everything and if you weren't so misinformed you would know this. 

I notice you post to geopolitics and worldnews which goes some way to explain why you are so misinformed / disinformed. 

If you think you can trust wikipedia for factual information you are sadly mistaken. Governments, Corporations and PR companies spend millions of dollars every year making sure Wikipedia doesn't have info that they wouldn't like it to have.

Why didn't you quote the best quotes from the DIA emails - have you something to hide or are you purposefully trying to muddy the waters with a nefarious agenda? 

From the articles:-

According to the newly declassified US document, the Pentagon foresaw the likely rise of the ‘Islamic State’ as a direct consequence of the strategy, but described this outcome as a strategic opportunity to “isolate the Syrian regime.” 

 “the Salafist [sic], the Muslim Brotherhood, and AQI [al-Qaeda in Iraq] are the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria,” the document states that “the West, Gulf countries, and Turkey support the opposition,” while Russia, China and Iran “support the [Assad] regime.”

The secret Pentagon document thus provides extraordinary confirmation that the US-led coalition currently fighting ISIS, had three years ago welcomed the emergence of an extremist “Salafist Principality” in the region as a way to undermine Assad, and block off the strategic expansion of Iran. Crucially, Iraq is labeled as an integral part of this “Shia expansion.”

The establishment of such a “Salafist Principality” in eastern Syria, the DIA document asserts, is “exactly” what the “supporting powers to the [Syrian] opposition want.” Earlier on, the document repeatedly describes those “supporting powers” as “the West, Gulf countries, and Turkey.”

Further on, the document reveals that Pentagon analysts were acutely aware of the dire risks of this strategy, yet ploughed ahead anyway.

The establishment of such a “Salafist Principality” in eastern Syria, it says, would create “the ideal atmosphere for AQI to return to its old pockets in Mosul and Ramadi.” Last summer, ISIS conquered Mosul in Iraq, and just this month has also taken control of Ramadi.

I have read over one hundred articles from a wide range of sources about how Obama, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey have been deliberately arming, training and recruiting Islamic Extremists such as Al-Nusra and ISIS for regime change in Syria from 2011.

You should try to do some reading of the facts on the ground to become less ill informed. 

I recommend you stay away from Corporate owned media as they lie all the time. 

Nafeez Ahmed was sacked from the Guardian because he wrote an article about Israel's natural gas reserves and about how Israel was supporting the program of regime change in Syria. Also because the Guardian appointed a rabidly pro zionist as head editor around the same time.

Nafeez has now gone freelance through crowd funding and this was how his medium.com article was written. 

No mainstream Corporate media outlet employs any honest investigative journalists any more. See Seymour Hersh, Robert Parry, John Pilger etc.

Shadowrun,3,0,3,"And he's fine against pistols wielded by gangers, but against a Professional with an assault rifle firing full-auto, he's rolling 40-6=34 dice (that's pretty optimized, also, it's generally less than that) for roughly 11 hits, against 11p + 6-7 net hits (-9 to defense pool for full auto) + 2p (called shot: vitals), which isn't a dead troll but is a pretty unhappy one.  Double Tap Bullseye from Run and Gun gives you an AP of -18 with APDS ammo in an Ares Alpha on any burst that fires 3 bullets or more, which leaves your troll in a real bad place.

Someone actually expecting a fully armoured troll (and they aren't exactly the sort of thing you can keep on the down low) might arm themselves with a panther xxl or other heavy weapon - less net hits (no full auto, so up to 3 less net hits on the defense test), but 17p base damage and -10 AP with APDS rounds - (-30 with Bullseye Double Tap).

Direct spells (such as manabolt, stunbolt etc) do a total damage of hits on the spellcasting test, resisted by hits on a body+wil test (or just wil, I forget).  Either way, they are going to take a very long time to whittle down a body 10 troll.  Generally you're better off tossing a relatively high force single target indirect spell, especially a Cold one - on a bad roll, the enemy's armour becomes useless.  But if you toss a Force 8 Flamethrower, you get 8+net hits damage, it has -8 AP, and you only roll against 4 physical drain (assuming magic 6).  Not ideal, but better than a manabolt that might only do 2ish boxes of damage.  Better yet, spend half your physical track and a point of Edge guffing up the biggest spirit you think you'll get a service for, point him at the troll, and watch the glory that is Elemental Attack (damage=twice force, AP=force, + net hits of a test of twice force +2-4, + elemental effect) or the terror that is Engulf (the less said about high-Force engulf, the better).

The real use of heavy armour is to defend against multiple attackers using quite small arms.  Like an armoured vehicle, against any weapon designed to take it on, it's at a disadvantage, and prepared skilled foes (professional with ares alpha and apds, or magic 6 mage, i.e. roughly shadowrunner level opponents) it's at about par.",t3_374lum,crjo5tu,t1_crjn9l8,t1_crjo5tu

AskReddit,2,0,2,"I think this comment by /u/lergerhs sums it up the best

&gt;I'm a dude, but the argument isn't hard to make.
Making the first move is something basically all guys have to do. It is intimidating but we all manage.
You just have to do what millions have already done, but your chances of rejection are significantly lower than what men face. Men aren't used to the luxury of the option of accepting or denying potential mates who throw themselves at our feet. We're not viewed as valuable, or precious, or desired. If a ship goes down, the women and children are worth saving. If a city is conquered, the women are taken, but the men are killed (I know this isn't good by any means, but the point is, we are never prized or valued.)
Men are not complimented ever. As a result of this the determining factors in male beauty are a mystery. Muscles, I suppose? I seriously don't know. I heard the male butt is found attractive once and it blew my mind. Seriously, anything on this topic would be incredibly enlightening. Men are supposed to win over the women and we don't even know what they're looking at or for; shallow answers are fine, just give us something. There is this standard of ladies being proper and a stigma around such a thing, but just say the word and I would be happy to do some squats. I know women feel they can be over-sexualized and held to impossible standards of beauty, but imagine growing up never even considered as a potentially attractive being simply because of your genitals. We're stereotyped as aggressive and brutish, creepy is a common one. We can be criminals and beasts, but never beautiful.
Rather than a judgmental audience, you would meet a grateful one. Come over, say hi. If you offer to buy ME a drink, I would buy you a ring.",t3_374cg7,crk4hnk,t1_crjn7s4,t1_crk4hnk

self,1,0,1,"Edit: (This is all IMHO)

First, your lack of self-confidence is the biggest thing in your way. Act confident, be confident - and that will express itself to others.

You are also applying your feelings about yourself to what you think her feelings about you will be - this is called *projection* and is also causing your indecision.

My opinion (and that is all it is) is that you should try to overcome your self-limiting. Project confidence and determination.  Be goal oriented.  Think carefully over how you can achieve your goals.

The best part is you have nothing to lose.  You already consider the cause lost - so really, if you are rejected it should be no big deal.

Work a bit on your own feelings and also in becoming more social. 

Let me give you an unrelated example (of goals).  I very much wanted to move to Hawaii. I had visited numerous times - but such a move is big, scary, costly, and most people can never do it.

I put a 7 year goal on moving to Hawaii.  Didn't happen in 7 years though. Other events in my life kept postponing it.

However, did I give up?  No.  I had a goal to meet.  Did it happen in 7 years?  No, but it did happen in 10.  And now I've been living here more than 18 years.

Goals are a very strong thing - if you use them correctly. Not achieving a goal is not a failure - but merely a bump in the road to what you really want in life.",t3_377b9f,crkantv,t3_377b9f,t1_crkantv

europe,7,0,7,"Did you read the article, or just pull the first sentence that supposedly confirms your beliefs? 

&gt; Somatic cell count, according to the industry’s own National Mastitis Council, “reflects the levels of infection and resultant inflammation in the mammary gland of dairy cows,” but somatic cells are not synonymous with pus cells, as has sometimes been misleadingly suggested. Somatic just means “body.” Just as normal human breast milk has somatic cells—mostly non-inflammatory white blood cells and epithelial cells sloughed off from the mammary gland ducts—so does milk from healthy cows. The problem is that many of our cows are not healthy.

So, Somatic cells are not inherently pus forming, only when the cow has mastasis, which at the time of this report, 1/6 of dairy cows in the US were estimated to be suffering from. 

If you actually looked at [the source](http://nmconline.org/articles/USDA_SCC_2010.htm) he provides for SCC in American milk you'd find it says,

&gt; In 2010, during all monitored months, 89.5% of the milk would have met a goal of 400,000 SCC (which is the current European Union SCC limit)

So, in conclusion, the vast majority of milk in the United States meets EU standards for SCC, with an estimated average SCC of between 224,000 and 272,000, depending on how you calculate it. Also, as of 2012, [all dairy products produced in the US for EU consumption have to meet EU standards.](http://www.nmpf.org/latest-news/articles/eu-somatic-cell-requirements-take-effect-next-month)

&gt; I want my milk European and without pus.

Well i'm sorry my good man, but EU regulation allows for up to 400,000 somatic cells per ml, so it's very possible that your glorious Yuropean milk has pus in it. If you want the closest thing to puss free milk, according to this [PDF](http://www.nmconline.org/articles/qualityeuro.pdf) Austria produces the best milk in the EU, with SCC levels around 100,000. So US milk is comparable in quality to milk produced in the UK, Germany, Sweden, and other countries with SCC levels around 200,000. But unlike in the US, milk in the EU is allowed to have a detectable level of drugs in it, so beware they might sap your precious bodily fluids. ",t3_376uqd,crkf5jk,t1_crkaq64,t1_crkf5jk

I use a mousse normally the VO5 smoothing one but sometimes since I've started plopping I've forgotten to do it before plopping, but that's for mainly frizz not making it curlier, maybe I could something more substantial when its warmer...Like a gel or cream? I have some hair serum at home I might give that a whirl next time! (I'm back home til late September, so I can't really go out and get anything til then...)

He said ""okay let's go"", I responded with "" I'll be back later "" he said ""okay"" and I went to do my other quests. I returned a bit later when I had leveled up to what the game recommended and now he is gone. The smith symbol and quest mark where he should be is there, but he is no longer present. Restarting the game and mediating will not fix it and I am out of ideas besides reloading a save from 20 plus hours of gameplay.

Guildwars2,12,0,12,"Too little dragged out over too much time.

Too many things not being spoken about.  Example:  New specs system will remove stats from trait lines and move some of them to armors, okay great but will this cause stats like toughness and conditions to begin to work more properly in PvE, the zerk meta exists because if you're hit by a 1 shot, no amount of toughness you can get is going to stop you from going down.  

Pet AI/control the true issue of the Ranger's ball and chain class mechanic, the thing either needs full micro management or it needs to be way smarter than every other NPC in the entire game to work right.  This is an issue for Necros attempting to run minion builds also.  And btw, wtf is with the flesh golem being hydrophobic?

Use of elite specs as band aids for current gaps in class capabilities.  Until players actually get to use the damn things we won't even know if these band-aids work, and several classes as mentioned still have rather harsh flaws at the deepest levels.  Skill diversity is welcome, but there needs to be a whole lot more.

Lack of ability to balance current super restrictive skill sets, means greater skill diversity mentioned above is actually a bad idea.  Which is not good.

""A few content dense maps"" omg.  Silverwastes?  Orr?  What?  There's something to be said for maps as big, and frankly as devoid of required participation as say, Brisban Wildlands.  They need to have a few gigantic and generally less 'dense' maps in the mix as well.  Right now it sounds like the jungle of HoT will be nothing but a massive non-stop grinder which stops being fun real fast.

Agree with the people who say that what we see so far doesn't really add up to ""expansion.""  Maybe this is only what they've polished of a much larger whole, but if this is the case then they announced WAY too early.

New class, Revenant.  No weapon swap and 2 *utility* bars via legends?  Wtf, unless everything else about this thing is OP as shit it sounds like an instant loser.  I'm worried it's going to get boring really fast for lack of build/skill diversity mentioned above.

There's plenty more but I'll quit now while I'm behind.  I'm still playing and will buy the Xpac when it comes out, I'm just worried about all the talk for so little to show for it.  They have a history of this with all their Living Story/World releases too,  1-2 hours of actual content, and 2-7 days of boring grind on every single one.

I'm far more excited about some of the changes I see in game now, houses opening up in DR, changes to Skrittsburg in Brisban, the optimization, new NPCs and a few additions that point towards new things in the Black Citadel, new LA.. things I can point at and explore now.  It's nice to know HoT is cooking, but there needs to be a lot more other stuff too besides blog posts and twitch streams to keep it real imo.",t3_3787tl,crkr9hp,t3_3787tl,t1_crkr9hp

You can definitely shave significant time off if you do a lot of long cardio pieces. Also make sure to work in a few other erg pieces or OTW pieces for sprint work.
Also for someone your size 28 is a very low stroke rating you wanna at least try to hit 33. To work on stroke rating lower the drag factor a little and do some sprint pieces. Like 20 x 1min, or 20 x 30 on 30 off. This will help you get used to a higher stroke rate since a lower drag can allow you to drive a little more quickly. Then gradually raise the drag factor back up on sprint work and combining that with cardio you'll be sub 7 in no time. Good luck!",t3_379nom,crkzndp,t3_379nom,t1_crkzndp

* Financial aid - In addition to my scholarships, I qualified for Pell grants and received SMART grants.
* Cheap apartment - My apartment that I rented was a 2/2 that was $675 per month that included internet and utilities with the exception of electricity. It had shit for amenities, no computer lab, no gym, terrible pool, mostly poorer upperclassman or grad students.
* Living cheap - I went to school in Florida and I did not even use the AC. I went out to eat maybe twice a month. Use the bus to get around.

Also, getting Defensive Stance might be a costly venture if you don't use a shield or bash regularly, but being able to move normally when blocking is hard to pass up, especially if you decide to charge into Valtheim Towers' or Blackreach's front door with a 2H sword and an armor rating of &lt;200.

childfree,2,0,2,"24/M - Philadelphia. 

Hey CF. I moved to Philly a little over a year ago from Texas, so I'm still getting used to a real winter. I play a lot of xbox, but mostly because my main goal is to save as much money as possible and spend it traveling the world. I've only been to New Zealand and Denmark outside the US (and Mexico, but I barely count that having lived in Texas) and also seen almost every state. I'm currently trying to find people to go on an international trip with me to lower costs. I have enough airline miles from work travel for multiple international flights but the more I can save the more I can travel. I also enjoy reading evolutionary biology and cosmology, because who doesn't want to know how we got here?

Most recent picture I have of me. It was a work event and I was pretty drunk but I don't take many pictures of myself so here it is.

Oh, and I can do that and attach a death benefit that will exceed the current account value so if you pass early your spouse can still have the IRA PLUS a death benefit to make up for lost social security / pension / whatever income.

AskReddit,0,0,0,"Well, according to Marx, it takes decades to even come close to what he considered is Communism, probably centuries. u need multiple revolutions to topple the government, with each revolution making the gap between the rich and the poor smaller and smaller, till it is no more and the government at **that** point releases power, giving us utopia *cue angels singing and light coming down from the heavens*

we will never know if it can be done, because it would be generations past that find out. To me, that is the main problem. All the other problems we talk about human nature and power corruption plus the poor distribution of wealth and people not having any motivation to work hard, are all reasons why communism the cycle is stopped. a computer simulation could do it, because it would not abandon the formula. Do i think it should be abandoned? idk, i doubt humans could follow a system through and through that has hundreds of years of war, and may never actually work to achieve utopia. 

plus, the government that has that much power would have to be filled with people as selfless as Gandhi and Jesus and Monks, in order to willingly give up the ability to exploit their power to keep the gap between the poor and the rich. ",t3_37bpdz,crljdi3,t3_37bpdz,t1_crljdi3

I'm hoping the Hawks will develop a reputation as a team where you can sign if you feel like you're undervalued as a player in the free agent market. There's nothing wrong with attracting talented, undervalued free-agents with a chip on their shoulder who believe in what Coach Bud's system represents. 

Honestly, I want Kevin Love to be devalued during his FA hunt. I could see him signing a deal with the Hawks until the new CBA if the money he's after isn't there.

I actually do know - pieliedie and wayto are absolutely shit players who have somehow convinced everyone in NA that they bring something to a team other than reaction time that rivals my 86 year-old grandfather with arthritis so bad he can barely hold onto his cane as he limps along with his fake hips and decision making skills that make a baby look impressive. Bulba isn't above a t2 player and I guess if you really want to see who can rice their face off the fastest black and qjoyva (sp?) might be up there with some of the best but neither of them can make game-winning decisions to save their lives.

Monkeys-forever has been nothing short of awful this entire tournament. He made big plays a few times against people who are incapable of looking at farm, looking at the enemy team and ending the game when they've obviously ahead. Fluff is shit. TC is shit. I don't even know who the other two players are. But honestly there should be no surprise here when the series is split 1-1. Mouz is a T2 team. They are not a T1 team and will no be a T1 team with this roster. 

TL;DR: Both these teams are terrible. Both of these games were awful. Why is anyone impressed by anything that happened?

Personally I am open to the idea of some kind of greater conciousness or something we can't conceive of having an effect on our existence, for the same reason I can't explain why the Universe exists. However I am also completely open to the possibility that there is nothing else out there whatsoever. The idea that one set of beliefs passed down through society and directly to me by my family is somehow the correct set of beliefs, is just unreasonable. There's plenty of evidence to show how many times the Bible has been warped by it's translators, how stories are skewed and manipulated over time.

China,2,0,2,"Even worse, because at least ""cocktales"" is an attempt at being funny, and indicates that there's gonna be booze and sex in Shanghai. Whereas ""penistales"" leaves the booze out.

Both sound to me like the title of some kind of quick-read novella sold in train stations or airports, with a crappy story that serves as an excuse for gratuitous violence and sex scenes. I tend to stay well away from those. I read a few when I was younger, but found them too formulaic and badly written for my taste.

I'll confess, I haven't read your book. But the quotes given in the review haven't really seduced me...

Tell you what, I'll send you my e-mail address by PM and if you think that I may enjoy your book, send me a PDF copy. But if it's half as bad as this review says it is, I won't be able to read to the end. I'm not a 20-something American college guy, and I never enjoyed ""American Pie"".

I don't judge books by their covers, but the title is usually a good indication of what's inside. Or at least it should be. So either ""cocktales"" was a bad idea, in which case I may like it, or it is an apt title, and then I probably will stop after something like 30 pages.

NoStupidQuestions,1,0,1,"There's a common misconception that you don't infringe copyright if you copy less than a certain ""magic"" amount of the original work eg less than 10 seconds. That's wrong. The test for infringement in different places is different, but it focuses on whether you took something that is qualitatively important. For example, in Australia there was recently a high profile court decision where copying 2 bars of a song (maybe 4 seconds of a 3 minute-ish song) was infringing because it was an important  2 bars. 

However, assuming that you copied enough to meet the bar for infringement, you can sometimes rely on an exception.  For example, in the US there is a defence of fair use. In the UK, NZ and Australia there is a defence of parody or satire. There are also exceptions for reporting news. This is where it gets really complicated because you have to look at WHAT was copied but also HOW is is being used. So for example, if I copied the songs from the case I was referring to before, to tell you about the case, that might not be an infringing use. But if I copy the exact same parts of the song but play it as background music for a bike repair tutorial, I don't have an exception I can rely on and so I would be infringing copyright. 

Best thing to do is always get permission from the owner. Not only does it mean you can avoid learning about copyright, it's also respectful to the artist. 

YouTube and other sites don't like to enforce copyright for owners.  Some artists might not know about how their songs are being used, or might not have the resources to report to YouTube to have them take down the songs. So the fact you can see something doesn't necessarily mean it's ok. There is heaps of infringing material on YouTube. ",t3_37exrp,crme0rp,t3_37exrp,t1_crme0rp

gardening,6,0,6,"Wiping them off is a perfectly fine solution, keep at it for some time, i.e. check them every morning for two weeks, and no new ones will come.

If you find that icky, you may spray them with fairly dilute dishwashing soap, soap is poison for them. Don't let too much drop onto the soil.

There are also chemical solutions, typical rose spray formulations will contain fungicides and systemic insecticides that will killl aphids as they begin to suck juices. I personally hate the spraying.

Finally aphids have predators that will arrive some time after the aphids themselves. I just leave aphids on certain ornamentals and herbs be (ex. clematis and dill) to attract the predators, they'll clean up not only these sacrificial plants but the whole garden. Ladybugs are voracious aphid eaters in all developmental stages.

OrthodoxChristianity,3,0,3,"Actually, I personally know Metropolitan Hilarion, who is mentioned in your website you linked! He is very kind and deals with church matters responsibly. I myself live in Manhattan and regularly attend the Synod of Bishops Church and St Nicholas Cathedral. 

I've been Orthodox my whole life, growing up in America and going to Russian Orthodox churches, whether they're Russian Orthodox or OCA churches (outside of Russia). 

So, here's what to expect when you're in an Orthodox Church: No pews. Sunday liturgy usually lasts 2 hours, depending on the parish, so there'll be standing. 

Communion is only for baptized Orthodox Christians. You may be baptized by any willing priest, having made arrangements and preparing, at any time in your life. Communion itself is given by the priest at the end of Liturgy, in a chalice, only when the parishioner  has gone to confession. Confession must be gone to before every Communion.  

A lot of insence. I'm not sure about Catholic Churches, but when the deacon censes you you must bow your head to it. Bread is usually blessed and given to all churchgoers upon the end of service, once everyone goes to the front in a line to kiss the cross which the priest holds.

Any questions you have I will be very happy to answer. Good luck!

Edit: Also, traditionally, non-baptized churchgoers must leave the church or stand in a back area after a certain time, when the deacon reads prayers for all non-baptized people of the world. However, this has been somewhat relaxed, and you could just stay.

Also, the way to cross yourself is slightly different and more traditional. Make a fist with your right hand, then put the tips of your thumb, index, and middle fingers together. Touch your head first, then right shoulder, left shoulder, and lower chest.",t3_37i2o8,crmyy4g,t3_37i2o8,t1_crmyy4g

brisbane,1,0,1,"&gt; It's going to happen. The recent ATO ruling that Uber drivers need to have an ABN and be registered for GST, means that the States have a lot to gain by making Uber legal - as the States are the primary recipients of the GST revenue.

The only question is if they're stupid enough to pull in Uber on the regulations, without speaking to anyone else like Lyft, or the others. 

In Kansas, they talked to a number of ridesharing companies(including Uber) while making new laws to basically make it much, much easier for rideshare companies to operate in the state. Uber didn't get what they wanted(Which, looking at their proposed version of the regulations, would have effectively locked out everyone BUT Uber, and basically completely deregulated Uber alone in all but name) they threw a big tantrum and had a whine about how persecuted they are, and how Kansas are making it impossible for ridesharing companies, before pulling out of the state.

Other ridesharing companies that aren't enormous bastards, needless to say, were quite happy with the regulations.

Say what you like about how nice and happy you are with Uber's service, or how uber drivers fart kittens and rainbows while taxi drivers are all nasty ogres who hit you with clubs and take your money, but Uber is still a fucking steaming shitpile of a company.

I'm 100% in favor of changing the laws for ridesharing to become legal and to allow them to compete with taxis on even standing, more than a little bit because that way I could use a service that's better than taxis without having to deal with the super-right-wing libertarian corporate nightmare that is Uber.",t3_37emfz,crn8gvb,t1_crmaeq8,t1_crn8gvb

science,20,0,20,"I completely agree with you, that was my first thought as well. The same thing happens with testosterone when an individual ingests ethanol post-workout, their post -workout testosterone levels increase by almost 100% due to the ethanol being prioritized for liver degradation. What people also need to remember is that just because a compound is in the blood for a longer period of time, doesn't mean that the biological activity is the same. In the case with testosterone and ethanol, the elevated testosterone levels after ethanol consumption did not show a corresponding elevation in cortisol, a hormone with catabolic and anti-anabolic physiological effects that is traditionally comparatively expressed to testosterone, so it can't be inferred whether or not the increase in testosterone blood levels is beneficial or not in regards to muscle growth and/or recovery[1]. So just because there is THC in the blood system for a longer period of time, doesn't mean the individual is getting an increased in in the period of psychedelic effects.

Lebron's finals appearances are definitely cheapened because he gets there playing weaker competition and there is no arguing that point. And the fact that he has a losing record in the finals backs up the point that the East is just not on par.",t3_37j4pp,crndnbg,t1_crn7oq1,t1_crndnbg
MuslimNoFap,2,0,2,"Brother, I get very depressed as well. I have been struggling with depression and pornography since ~14 I'm 22 now. I started uni this year and I've discussed all of these issues with a counsellor. I find that it has helped. In truth there is only so far that you can go with non-muslim counsellors, but sometimes talking about the depression is extremely helpful.

If that's not an option for you, perhaps you could talk about the depression to a close friend. If not then talk to an aalim that you like. 

I feel like a munafiq for offering this advice. We should be of such a level that we can talk to Allah about this and it would suffice... But I am weak in my iman. May Allah save us.

Another thing I've though of is that whether or not you agree with Tablighi Jamaat, I'm startign to think that going out with them for 40days could solve my problem. There are a lot of reputable ulama that support them. You can search for it on askimam. I know that a lot of salafi sscholars are very public on youtube and the internet about there dislike for this group. I've been around these sort of people for the past couple of years and I haven't noticed any actual bidat or bad practices. It's something to think about bro.

Games,52,0,52,"This is one of the few games I consider to be a piece of art. At face value it's overarching theme is the trappings of Death, but in truth it is actually centered around the concept of Loss. Every named character in the game has lost or does lose something important to them. Be it family, loved ones, agency in their lives, their dreams, or even something as simple as a refuge from their daily lives. The major developments of every character is centered on these different forms of Loss and their ability or inability to move on in their lives.

Opinions are mixed on whether not being able to directly control your allies is a good or bad thing, with most believing that the system was an annoying hamstring. I always thought that it helped both flesh out the character's personalities and demanded a bit of foresight from the player. Tetrakarn and Makakarn go from being annoyances to something you actually have to try and play around.

That said, the game does have some issues. The Fatigue system, while undoubtedly was intended to hamstring any efforts at grinding felt unneeded with how scarce SP restoration items were. Tartarus was also naturally gated so that you could not advance until the In-game calander reached certain thresholds.  

Social Links also had some...issues of their own mechanically. A large number of them end with romantic intentions. This naturally would cause tension with some of the other ones and would force the player to spend a day trying to fix Reversed Links or hope they don't end up Breaking them. This makes the correct way to handle this when trying to max all of them is to focus on these ""romantic"" links one at a time, Max them, and then move on to the next quickly. This comes across as being a bit of a dick.


I personally think with all of it's flaws, the FES version should be considered a mandatory game for any fan of JRPGs. And if you've got the guts (And the patience) play it on Hard.",t3_37k6sr,crne8it,t3_37k6sr,t1_crne8it

I also have a hug-only policy at the end of first dates, and I try to be mindful of body language and the circumstances of the date. Like, if I'm on a coffee date, my expectations are limited to just chatting and maybe walking around the neighborhood. Friend stuff. There's more potential for physical chemistry on a drink date, but even then it's no more than brief and light.

The chief thing to understand, of course, is that you, as a dude, want to avoid doing anything that might be perceived as sexually aggressive and violent. That's the guiding principle.

You're looking at probation with a suspended sentence and fine, no permanent anything. Just get a lawyer, and quit taking legal advice from strangers.


EDIT: A note on federal law enforcement:

I often read of people who seem to think that dealing with federal courts is worse than local or state courts. Don't get me wrong, if you go to club fed for capital murder, your life is going to suck now, until you die (get killed). However, they don't give a shit about a misdemeanor drug possession, at all. I've seen people get federal probation for second and third time interstate drug trafficking charges.

But anyways, yeah, this is definitely just something that lessens with time. If you've already told your gf how you feel then I wouldn't repeat too much (since it might be slightly awkward), but if you haven't, maybe it's something nice for her to hear? Otherwise, I'd say just keep doing what you're doing. It'll get better with time, maybe a couple months if you've JUST realized you're in love. 

(Cheesy advice: sometimes I make playlists that remind me of him or draw him ((I'm kind of artsy)) if I'm really missing him, makes it a little better; find outlets for yourself like those, even if they feel ridiculous, since it sometimes helps from being overly clingy when you're with them-- the key is not to smother them, yeah?)",t3_37kzmt,crnxfes,t3_37kzmt,t1_crnxfes

Neuropsychology,6,0,6,"Clinical neuropsychologist here.  You have a solid foundation for a doctoral program in clinical psychology, including your particular majors as well as experience with a mental health population.  Your GPA MIGHT be a bit low for more competitive programs, but I certainly wouldn't turn a student away over 3.4 GPA, particularly if you have decent GRE scores and interview well.  I suggest you apply to multiple programs to get your foot in the door at one of them.  

Your lab experience and work as a counselor will serve as assets, in the sense of showing a program that you have had some exposure to the mental health world and know what you want to do with that.  That experience can work against you if you go into an applicant interview and come off with an overconfidence of already being ready for specialization, as professors want somebody who is ready to learn.

I sometimes see students attempting to specialize in neuropsychology before they even have a solid foundation in psychology, but there is plenty of time for specialization in neuropsychology in graduate school, internship, and then the 2 year post-doctoral residency or fellowship.  Although it helps to go to a doctoral program that has neuropsychology as an emphasis or as a track, it is not necessary in my opinion.  I went to a Psy.D., clinical psychology program with a focus on Health Psychology and still ended up in competitive placements in neuropsychology on both internship and residency.",t3_37m689,crnxri3,t3_37m689,t1_crnxri3

running,1,0,1,"What sort of speed session are you thinking about.

My schedule for the week looks like:

* Monday: Easy Run/Rest
* Tuesday: Run/Bike Steady
* Wednesday: Club Session (Tempo)
* Thursday: Track Session (""5K Race Pace"" - Speed)
* Friday: Easy/Steady Run (Possibly + Bike Ride)
* Saturday: ParkRun with 2 mile warm-up and cool down (Possibly + Bike Ride)
* Sunday: Long Run (Possibly + Bike Ride)

I'm trying to build up my cycling so I can commute. But it's not a huge deal if I have to drop the bike sessions as it's a life goal rather than something where I have a target race to aim for.

In terms of rest days I generally throw them in as needed. Either the Monday or the Friday (or both) tend to be rests. However as I'm coming back from a cold I picked up all my runs are pretty easy pace-wise this week, so I'm not too worried about my legs - hence no rest day this week.

 [**Varney the Vampire**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varney%20the%20Vampire): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;___Varney the Vampire; or, the Feast of Blood___ was a [Victorian era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_era) serialized [gothic horror](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_horror) story by [James Malcolm Rymer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Malcolm_Rymer) (alternatively attributed to [Thomas Preskett Prest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Preskett_Prest)). It first appeared in 1845–47 as a series of cheap [pamphlets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pamphlet) of the kind then known as ""[penny dreadfuls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_dreadful)"". The story was published in book form in 1847. It is of epic length: the original edition ran to 876 double-columned pages divided into 220 chapters.  Altogether it totals nearly 667,000 words.  Despite its inconsistencies, *Varney the Vampire* is more or less a cohesive whole. It is the tale of the [vampire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire) Sir Francis Varney, and introduced many of the [tropes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trope_(literature\)) present in [vampire fiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire_fiction) recognizable to modern audiences to this day.

Pathfinder_RPG,1,0,1,"Vital Strike can be done via the ""Single Attack"" category and writing in a larger damage die. I haven't considered Mythic Power Attack... I know how I'd do it, but it would result in an 18ish option ong list to account for all the variables. I'll try to come up with a more elegant solution. Given the existance of Spirited Charge and Lances, even non-Mythic characters might seriously benefit from that option.

Mythic Power Attack can be done just by editing the existing Power Attack formulas. if you double click the gray boxes where Power Attack gives bonuses down in the buf table, it should be fairly self-evident where to change the numbers. Unfortunately, there is straight-up no way to include the ""deal Power Attack damage AGAIN after calculating out a critical hit.""

I can't remember if Mythic Deadly Aim does something beyond ""more damage"" (why are you taking Mythic Deadly Aim anyways?! Go get Mythic Rapid Shot/Manyshot first!), but, similar to Power Attack, you should be able to just change numbers in the gray boxes and make it work.

At this point Netflix is trying to make watching movies and TV as simple as possible, and often the best ways to do that are to remove features, not add them. Especially at their level, it's tough to add niche features without alienating someone or having it bite you when it doesn't work right or causes unexpected issues elsewhere.

If the video and audio streams are packaged in a container format already like they usually are, the cost goes up even more because now you need to store 5.1 likely audio in it's own container with a very low bitrate black screen.

Showerthoughts,32,0,32,"My brother died last year at age 21 in a freak accident (he was renovating, some wood fell on his head and gave him a concussion. He didn't realise anything was wrong, went to the gym that night and passed out and died walking home from an aneurysm). 

Anyway, my favourite photo of him is a series of four pictures that my sister took and posted on instagram in a 'grid' a few weeks before he died. He was just driving her home from high school one day. It was raining so he swung by her school to pick her up so she wouldn't have to walk to/from the bus in pouring rain. One of the photos she took before he realised, then he made a face at her when she realised she was taking a photo, then she said 'no, smile nicely' so he did and the fourth one is a selfie she took when they were stopped at a red light.

For some reason, I love those pictures so much more than any posed picture. They're just pictures of him living his life as we knew him and being the nice dude that would go and pick up his 16 year old sister from school and that's the way I remember him. It's really nice to have pictures like that, even if some people would roll their eyes at my siblings for taking pictures while driving home from school.",t3_37n0vn,croo7if,t1_crojgq4,t1_croo7if

if you go to gaychurch.org, believeoutloud.org, awab.org (baptist churches), you can find some lists separated by state. luckily a lot of churches have a presence on social media, so you can kinda get a feel for how they present themselves. of course you won't know everything till you go in, but looking on facebook pages, the events pages on their sites, etc kinda gives me an idea of how open they are to lgbt members.

advertising,7,0,7,"Hey - comms strategy guy here.  a couple questions first and then some thoughts.

1.  Who's the audience?  Assuming younger people who have a current mobile phone plan w/ data.  Any other details?  
2.  What's the objective?  Drive traffic to store with a promotion? Make people aware of a new store?  Get people to reconsider your client with a product differentiator or benefit (like low cost or improved coverage)?

Answers to these questions will help determine whether radio or Pandora are the right thing to invest in.  Might be that your client should be doing something totally different.

In my view, Pandora (and all free streaming radio) is a better radio ad medium than terrestrial radio.  As a listener you are much less likely to avoid the ads (because you kinda cant without paying), and you are more accepting of ads as they are underwriting your free music service.  As an advertiser they offer more precise targeting, better measurement and analytics.  The downside is that the reach (total audience) is likely lower (perhaps not for an 18 y/o, though) and there isnt as tight a connection between the audience and the station / DJ.  

I wouldnt worry about wearout (people hearing it too many times).  Pandora can limit the frequency that a specific user will hear your ad.  You can work with them to balance frequency, reach and the # of spots you should create to find the ideal mix between the two.  

As for cutting through the clutter, that's where a sharp strategy and creativity go to work.   ",t3_37pqea,crosf11,t3_37pqea,t1_crosf11

(But I'm sure I would get some resistance if I announced that they weren't ""allowed"" to wear dresses or skirts on those occasions when they felt like it.)

If you sometimes desperately want to feel fancy and dressed up, but other times just feel kind of ""meh, whatever"", that's just average human.  Also, it's human to want attention.

Also, for me at least, choosing what to wear each day is managing all sorts of internal and external pressures.  I know what society wants me to wear.  I know what looks good on my body.  I know what I want to wear.  All of those things are in conflict.  So just wearing what makes me feel most comfortable becomes complicated because there is comfort and discomfort in every direction.  So, from day to day (and sometimes minute to minute), I might come up with a different solution.

Couple notes:

- Yeah, you're probably not too far off the mark with this being unnecessary. However, it might give a group of 20th level hardened characters a chance to run through a 10-15th level module and have it be somewhat challenging. I know most people just retire old characters and very few people play them up to 20th, but this might be a nice way to revisit old favorites.

- With old man strength, yes and no. I'm somewhere inbetween old and young man, and as I see it, the older men (especially from previous more labor-intensive generations) work their bodies more on a day to day basis. You can get plenty strong outside of a gym. Whereas young guys who hit the gym, at least in my case, spend their youth fucking around with mirror ""show"" muscles and are bench and curl monkeys who rarely squatted, did deadlifts or understood the value of complex multi-joint movements. Even with pretty experienced bodybuilders, a lot are surprisingly weak with real-world strength (or at least nowhere near as strong as you'd think by looking at them).",t3_37qxd5,crp39wd,t1_crp2x6p,t1_crp39wd

But I would put my energy into training young plants without removing any  vegetation unnecessarily for clones just yet. 

In a few weeks, the plants will have little side shoots down low that you will want to prune anyway. Those tender shaded stems clone very well. 

As long as you start clones about 2 weeks before you plan on going to 12/12, you will be guaranteed to have your next generation in place.

starcraft,1,0,1,"MMR is not useless- that is your true rank in the eyes of matchmaking.

Leagues on the ladder are basically useless, especially because there are no mid-season demotions. This means that those players in Gold and Platinum were somewhat close to your MMR, otherwise you wouldn't have been matched up against them.

If you're winning more than 50% of your games, the ladder tends to constantly place you against higher players as it assumes you're getting better at the game. This arbitrary assumption the system is making is based on your MMR, not your league.

You'd have no issue with this if you would just disregard league distribution, play, and try to get better (or have fun, some people don't care about getting better and that's fine.)

Also, being intimidated by a Platinum player after playing StarCraft since you were 5 years old is a bit silly in my opinion.

I've been playing for 17 years and still suck, but will gladly hang and play customs with you if you'd like to break into Gold or Platinum some day.

TrueReddit,3,0,3,"You might be misunderstanding what the word phobia means.  It means ""an extreme or irrational fear of something"".  When you have a phobia of heights, it means you're extremely afraid of being high up, even when you're -- rationally speaking -- very safe[1].

&gt; Of course we're death phobic. The alternative is nothingness.

The idea that nothingness is literally the worst possible thing that the human soul can experience is almost demonstrably untrue.  It's rare to find someone who has nothing that they would die for (the easiest example is one's children);  similarly, people choosing death over (e.g.) torture has been happening throughout recorded history.  As cited upthread, the fact that doctors tend to choose much quicker, cleaner deaths is a clue that the way that the average person approaches death in America isn't based on survival instinct as much as a misunderstanding of what staying alive would entail with certain terminal diseases.

[1] The usual response to this is ""mechanical engineering isn't 100%, being high up can still be dangerous"".  That's true of anything, so let's just say ""much safer than you are every time you get in a car, which you're not nearly as afraid of doing"".",t3_37qh5w,crphw7f,t1_crphcei,t1_crphw7f

neopets,-5,0,-5,"I was joking with the numbers but if you're that eager, lets entertain the idea for a bit.

First, nobody is forcing you to pay for premium so that point is garbage here, lol. And nobody would be forcing you to pay for the UC. Just let it expire and...well, you still have a pet, with more custom options. The change is purely cosmetic, unlike the pay to win nature of premium so whats the problem?

On the other side of things, Neo gets money, and as a business that's what they're supposed to do. If people are willing to shell out cash to keep their ego afloat, then let the market speak for itself. Capitalism, ho! Hell, their microtransaction currency expires for fucks sake and people still eat that shit up. People will threaten to pull their subs and stuff but lets be honest here, if claims from other games hold true, and given the nature of the Neo community, a lot of the vocal outcries are made by the hypocritical whales themselves.

Then I would invite strangers and friends to join me for whatever period of time they would like. It would be nice to fall in love, but certainly not expected.

Today all of these things that aren't available to millennials. To go to college you need to take between $20k to $60k in loans to go to a state college and with those degrees a graduate will most likely work a job that they didn't need to go to college for years, a non college graduate will have to work multiple jobs well working 60-80 hours a week to survive, and having families in your 20s is becoming less realistic every year.

worldevents,5,0,5,"If N number of people use drugs that may result in an overdose then some subset will indeed overdose. Many people overdose from alcohol alone, let alone mixing it with other drugs (over the counter or otherwise) and I haven't gotten to accidents from alcohol related events. Prohibition created organized crime in the USA. Prohibition was a complete and utter failure. It never stopped politicians judges prosecutors or cops from drinking, it just criminalized a common behavior. Other drugs are also fairly common, and the war on drugs created and funded organized crime as well as justified a surveillance state (think of the children!) So while drug dealers killing their competitors and breaking the bones of people that owe then money is very very very bad, I don't really think selling drugs itself is worthy of life in prison or the death sentence and I definitely don't want to pay 60k a year for decades to house somebody in max security because they made their own Ebay site for drugs. The market to buy drugs already existed; he didn't create a market. He didn't advertise to new potential clients, spamming them with ad banners. The market was there. Until society can eliminate the demand for drugs, it is hypocritical to criminalize suppliers. I hate the lotto and lottery with all my heart and think it is evil and predatory to take advantage of foolish poor people but I recognize  there is a demand and the government is simply supplying that demand.",t3_37rkcq,crpnpfs,t1_crpcu17,t1_crpnpfs

Guildwars2,2,0,2,"Overall, I like the changes. I wasn't playing when they were added, but have go to use most since I returned. Before, leveling alternate characters by exploring the world was rather dull since I've done map completion before; but the Content Guide system made it more fun and bearable to redo maps for me. The new level up icon/menu and leveling rewards are also nice; makes each level feel a bit more unique and encourages me to work at certain levels for traits and such.

Having the personal story split into chapters every 10 levels is nice and I think the rewards were improved as well. Can't say I like the removed and moved chapters, but they are fixing that soon so.  I did like having to unlock skills per weapon, but don't really mind it being by level now either. The trait unlock system was before that update I think; never affected me but doesn’t matter either way with new system.

math,3,0,3,"&gt; What do you think if you see A(a,b)?
It could be the function A evaluated in the point (a,b)  

But making the notation itself totally unique for every possible case, would take away the simplicity and flexibility we have.  
I mean, even if we suppose A(a,b) will just be used for denoting a function, then how do we differentiate between complex and real functions? What are 'a' and 'b'? Numbers (which ones), vectors? etc.    
The symbol itself is just a shortage, so we only once at the beginning have to write out, what we are working with.  
There are only 2 options: Either giving some outwritten context and use short (but sometimes repetitive) notation, or having huge symbols with indices everywhere that give all the necessary context by themselfs.  
But what I like about math is, that I can use f.e. 'I' as a matrix, a group of indices or a function or whatever I want it to be, as long as I beforehand give enough information on what it's going to be.",t3_37ucl0,crpz2mj,t3_37ucl0,t1_crpz2mj

twitchplayspokemon,4,0,4,"Good, well thought up write-up.

The focus here is that PBR is main game and runs are intermission. For me, this is the case, and it does cause some issues during runs, since betting ppl are used to hanging around TPP but might not really enjoy runs.

On the other hand... I touched on this a bit but rushing too many runs a year just gives us less stuff for the future. Maybe 4 runs a year is one too less, but l think the current pace is healthy. The bigger problem is that because of the lower amount of runs, a lot of ppl want them to be ""bigger"" and this usually means artificially raising difficulty without much thought often. Instead, we should try and decide stuff that needs to be done during a run - and it can be more than just catching all mons and defeating E4. Having to win contest, having to collect certain items, etc... Lots of stuff that can be done.

Maybe one solution is making the PBR run more meaningful. Being able to do chain commands for Crystal had sped things up and made progress more regular and more exciting. We could also maybe have up to 5 mins every hour with anarchy. and if we only play romhacks - that doesnt really fit as main runs imo - it doesnt really matter how many we beat. 

Another simple solution is to bring back Stadium side betting during runs. I mean, we have runs during PBR so the opposite could work too.",t3_37uip4,crq08j7,t1_crpz3s8,t1_crq08j7

changemyview,1,0,1,"Your view is very interesting, because it made me seriously think about the legality of producing snuff vs the legality of viewing it, and why it is different in this scenario.

So here is what I can muster.

*If* you can show that legalizing the viewing of child pornography will *only* do the following:

* Lower the chances of the *viewers* going out and abusing children themselves
* *Not* lead to more people viewing child pornography
* *Not* lead to a greater demand to create more child pornography

Then I would agree with you. You've provided a study that talks about the first point, i.e. lowering the rate of child abuse *in the area where the viewing is taking place*. So on one hand, child abuse is lowered in one area, and in the area where the pornography is being produced, we are assuming it just isn't increased. Whilst not great, numerically this seems better than before.

However, if there is sizeable chance that legalizing the pornography would lead to more people viewing it or to producers producing more of it, then we run the risk of endangering more children, or putting the children who are already being abused in greater danger in order to meet the new demands of the consumers and/or producers.

It is a heavy risk to take. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want to lower the chance of a child abuser abusing a child in place X at the cost of increasing the  suffering for children in place Y where the filming is taking place. If a study showed that this wouldn't be the case, then I would agree with you. As it stands, my gut tells me that the result would be more children suffering.",t3_37u0y6,crq0aup,t3_37u0y6,t1_crq0aup

Israel could announce nukes, then people could call for the funding to be cut, then someone could come up with some other ""policy"" under which the funding would be allowed, and the funding would ultimately continue.  
  
People seem to think that international politics is some kind of game of absolute blacks and whites. It is anything but that. It is a massive sea of gray fuzzy interpretations and desires.

Under intense scrutiny, you would be convicted of theft.

starcitizen,8,0,8,"""A better mindset""? 

In answer to your post above, how do I imagine the game years from now? I can't. I don't know what the PU will offer or what will be possible. My only advice is to look at the history of MMOs. If you want an example, research how Star Wars Galaxies was years after launch but before the NGE or Combat Upgrade. That's a small example of what ""might"" be.

There is very, very little in the way of information regarding the PU. I hear a lot of ""we want to do this"" but there hasn't been tech demos to back up most of it. That's perfectly fine, I'm not even skeptical, I'm just wary of imagining a future game that might not be. I caution people to do the same. Game engines are, at their heart, a game engine. Working in this industry, there are limitations and sometimes those limitations lead to wonderful innovations and sometimes they lead to simple answers when people wanted something complex.

CIG has innovated a great deal and for that, I am continually impressed and blown away. It is however, a studio with a budget that's HALF of what was spent on Destiny's Development and SWTOR's development. Half. That's a lot of innovation on a small budget that makes me want to congratulate the vision and leadership of its Producers and Designers. Chris Roberts knows what he wants and how to do it.

So what do I think it will be? I don't know. I'm sorry but I don't. What I want? I'd like for us to be able to create guilds and organizations that can do missions together. I want more co-operative content. I want the UEE to post missions for us to take that require various resources (our civilian people to get resources, build materials and our military to attack or carry it out). I want small things that my wife and I can do together, such as carry cargo from Vega to the frontier and fend off small bandit attacks.

I want to be able to hang out and meet my guildmates on the surface of planets, to conduct our operations in game as much as possible rather than on TS. I want my sandbox back where we can create little homes and stations to upgrade and customize. I want this studio to live on and on and on and keep pushing out new Squadron 42 chapters. 

Most of all, I want them to surprise me. I want them to look at the limitations of online games and crush them and to open up the flood gates for OTHER studios to innovate. Right now everyone sits back, afraid to do so because it might not sell. If you don't sell, you are closed and all your people are unemployed.

If you haven't worked in this world, then you can't imagine how incredibly frightening things can be. Polygon writing an article that you have ""not enough endgame"" and dropping your score on Metacritic from a 9 to a 6 is devastating. People are subjective and a lot of people buy based on subjective comments. Wildstar had huge hype and expectations and when it was just a solid, simple game? It died. (Bugs aside but every game has bugs, and that's a whole other story)

Calling an experience illusory doesn't reject the experience, it simply re-interprets it.  Physics has taught us that a lot of our experiences are illusory.  The Earth orbits the sun, tables are mostly empty space, that when you go to touch something, you aren't actually making contact with it and are instead feeling it's repulsive force.  Rejecting those positions simply because it would paint our experiences as illusory is just an appeal to emotion. ",t3_37vmbz,crqbenb,t3_37vmbz,t1_crqbenb

First of all, I actually want to thank you, because no one ever says that.

Secondly, with ""putting words in your mouth"", that'll be because every other person with access to a keyboard who doesn't like it is hell bent on deconstructing every aspect of the song to definitively prove that the song is indeed inherently bad, perhaps with a sprinkling of ""Matt's run out of ideas"" or ""it's too easy, it's lazy"", etc. 

And yeah, while there are the equally insufferable fanboys, I find the former to be more common around the hardcore Muse communities, for obvious reasons.

The only time Arin really seriously fucks up is when he **compares** things.

Like, this 2D game where you can see more of the room at once, I see a treasure chest, anticipation builds.  3D game where a chest might not be as apparent, has a 2-second cutscene to hype you up instead.  OBVIOUSLY THE SECOND ONE IS AWFUL BECAUSE I LIKE LTTP MORE.

If you use a scope to view the voltage across the coil you'll probably see something like half the wave missing which is causing your chattering.

I'd prove your control circuitry by using a different power source for everything powered by the UPS. You can measure the power required for everything and size up your UPS that way - you aren't needing the power for a long time so the capacity isn't that important but you need your power consumption to be under the max rated for the device.

You are also generating some fairly large fields with that kind of power, you have no back EMF supression on those coils so I'd be worred that when you switch from parallel to series the only place the induced voltage can be dissipated is into the bridge - so you might be damaging it.",t3_37ui7m,crqpovu,t3_37ui7m,t1_crqpovu

I mean seriously. He was on **Samsung White**. With the best jungler, the best support, top 3 ADC, a top laner who was perfect for worlds meta. Then he left Samsung White. OK, time to finally prove himself. Moves to EDG. The best toplaner, the best ADC, top 3 jungler, rising star support. He's got an embarrassment of riches.

Against Ezhoon, he got rekt in the Cass vs Orianna matchup. Then in the reverse matchup,  he got rekt in lane even after having a kill and 2 assists. Against Faker, he did ok first game in lane, but then late game Kass steamrolled em. Second game, with morg counter pick, he was still down in CS. Faker has to make do with a tilty top laner, a well past his best jungler, and a feeder of a support. ",t3_37yarh,crqtmeo,t1_crqsqdk,t1_crqtmeo

So the i3 is better at multi-threaded tasks such as video encoding or if you were streaming yourself playing LoL. If you find yourself getting into more CPU intensive games (BF4, FC4, etc.) then you'll start seeing a difference between the two as more games start to use more cores.

marriedredpill,2,0,2,"&gt; well, can you really blame her? She's a woman. And I mean her hubby let it happen.

A few things make this woman stand out. She's super dominant. She's also pushing the ""we must turn our men beta"" thing to the extreme, like telling me ""Sepean, men aren't supposed to be ripped"". I get that it is in women's nature to shit test and try to get their men to comply, but this doesn't resolve them of the responsibility for the consequences. They are pushing their men in the wrong direction and that matters morally. They are also lying and setting up false expectations when they say it is due to the stress of small children; they're not going to begin fucking when the kids are older, are they?

I also get the hamstering that women come up with too justify them not fucking their BB husbands; I'm tired, stressed, low libido, yada yada. But most women have at least a bit of sympathy for the hell that a dead bedroom is for their husband. A few months ago we were 6 people having dinner and she chose to proclaim loudly to all of us that it was unmanly to expect sex from a mother with young children. She said that in front of her husband and his friends, like she was on some moral high horse because she was focused on the kids. That's emasculation in public, so cruel.

Horror, Thriller [[USA:PG-13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America_film_rating_system#Ratings), 1 h 23 min]  
Mark Duplass, Olivia Wilde, Sarah Bolger, Evan Peters  
Director: David Gelb

**IMDb rating:** [](#movieguide_stars)**&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9733;&amp;#9734;&amp;#9734;&amp;#9734;&amp;#9734;&amp;#9734;** **5.2**/10 (4,204 votes)

&gt; THE LAZARUS EFFECT follows a group of researchers led by Frank and his fiancé Zoe who've achieved the unimaginable - bringing the dead back to life. After a successful, yet unsanctioned, trial on a newly deceased animal, the team is ready to unveil their breakthrough to the world. When the dean of their university learns of their underground experiments, their project is unexpectedly shut down and their materials confiscated. Frank, Zoe and their team take matters into their own hands, launching a rogue attempt to recreate their experiment, during which things go terribly wrong and one of their own, Zoe, is horrifically killed. Fueled by terror and grief, Frank pushes them to do the unthinkable\: attempt to resurrect their first human test subject. Initially, the procedure appears a success, but the team soon realizes something is wrong with Zoe. As her strange new persona reveals itself, the team quickly becomes stuck in a gruesome reality. They are no longer faced with the question of whether they can bring someone back to life- but rather, the wrath of her return.

ireland,0,0,0,"Someone posted about Hebrew in another thread. There were many reasons for that revival - such as to unify smaller regions with differing language and to strengthen Israel as a solid nation. They also mentioned that the ""new"" Hebrew introduced is probably different from the original Hebrew. We simply don't have any incentive on that sort of level to justify re-introducing a language.

I think that it would be nice to incorporate the language in a history/culture class, to educate people on its influence on modern Ireland. But I don't see any logical reason to teach it to fluency to kids that won't ever get benefits from it, besides understanding the commentary on sports events on TG4. The fact that ""it'd be cool to have it"" isn't enough IMO.

serialpodcast,8,0,8,"Real life is not black and white.  In real life, it is common that many witnesses for the other side of a case also may be able to give testimony that is potential helpful, *especially* if other witnesses deviate from expected testimony.  

Attorneys subpoena witnesses expected to testify for the other side so they can avoid being caught short if the testimony deviates from what was expected, and the prosecutor then decides to forego using those witnesses. 

Let's say hypothetically there is a case that rests on eyewitness identification of a robber.  The defense plans to argue mistaken identification. Five witnesses identified the defendant as the robber from a photo showup, but three had also given descriptions earlier that were not entirely consistent with the defendant's appearance:  for example, let's say that the defendant is a man of medium height and build, but witnesses A, B, &amp; C told police initially that the robber was tall and heavy set.   The prosecutor lists A,B,C, D, &amp; E as potential witnesses, but at trial decides only to call witnesses D &amp; E -- neither of whom gave a prior description to the police.  How is the defendant going to let the jury know about those previous descriptions?   

It's still a judgement call at time of trial-- after all, A, B, &amp; C will probably now testify that they recognize the defendant as the robber.  But an experienced lawyer wants to preserve the ability to make that call after the prosecution's case has been presented, so they can evaluate at that point whether or not the prior statements of A, B, &amp; C are helpful to the defense.  

So an attorney is going to look at the prosecution's witness statements, the discovery, and their own investigation and ask: ""is there anything these witnesses can testify to that I might want the jury to know?"" -- and if the answer is ""yes"" - the defense is going to issue that subpoena, unless the lawyer is absolutely certain that it would be impossible for the prosecution to present its case without the testimony of that witness.  (That is: CG wouldn't subpoena Jay, because if Jay is a no-show... there is no case. )

Even if a witness' testimony looks completely unhelpful -- it could be important if another witness comes in and testifies to something unexpected, that the other witness would contradict.  So its generally good practice to issue those extra subpoenas.   ",t3_37zjdl,crrahkt,t1_crr7t0f,t1_crrahkt
