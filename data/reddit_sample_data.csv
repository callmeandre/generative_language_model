dotamasterrace,11,0,11,"Lemme take a quote from this article:

""Chaos is the soul of Dota, but chaos is undesirable when your game is also a service. XP bars and microtransactions represent an investment of player time and money, and players expect that investment to be protected by a game's developers. MOBAs need to be balanced and fair and reliable as a courtesy to their long-term players.

Dota doesn't.

That's why there's nothing like it, and the 6.84 update symbolises that perfectly. The reward for your years-long involvement with this game isn't measured in progression bars or an expanding roster of characters: it's measured in the number of times you've looked at the patch notes and thought 'this changes everything.' Dota isn't just three lanes and ten players. Dota is crazy shit.""

Be proud of icefrog and Valve, fellow master race brothers. They know how to balance a game and keep a game fun.

AskReddit,2,0,2,"The longer and stronger you bottle something or someone up, the stronger will be the explosion when the valve is opened. For centuries, being found to be homosexual could and would lose you your friends, family and social standing. If you were known to be having sex, you could be arrested and imprisoned or placed in a mental hospital, or ""chemically castrated"" (or possibly really castrated). Or you might just be dragged into an alley and beat to death.

Now that there's one day-- *one day* in many big cities where non-straight people can be whoever and whatever without fear of complete social ruin or worse-- after centuries of what really is describable as oppression-- it's natural that they're going to be really wild'n crazy.

As social acceptance grows, pride parades will, as likely as not, get much tamer, or even fade away altogether.

I looked at the source video, and there were about 90,000 comments of mostly ""I agree with you"".

self,2,0,2,"I think there are definitely oppressed women in the US. I don't consider myself oppressed, and I'm not sure how you define oppression, but the way I define it, I would consider women in abusive families/subcultures within the US might be oppressed. For instance, women whose families and social groups prevent them from seeking education. I would consider them oppressed. But I would never say all men are oppressive. Personally I think oppression has to include a coordinated effort from multiple people. So women in the US aren't oppressed by society as a whole, but some women might be oppressed by their societies within the US, if that makes sense.

That said, I do think that suggesting all women are oppressed and all men are oppressors is incredibly offensive both to me, as a woman, and to all the men in my life. To suggest my father, my boyfriend are oppressive is something I am very at odds with. Not only because, while they may say some things I think are sexist or hold some beliefs I disagree with they always listen to me and have an equal discussion, but also to suggest they are oppressing me is to suggest I lack the agency to make my own decisions. There is nothing keeping them in my life but me- I am out of the house, my boyfriend and I don't live together. If I wanted to, I could cut them both out of my life with no social, financial, or other ill effects. But I don't, because I feel that they lift me UP, not push me down.

Not to mention that it is a very ethnocentric view to suggest Western men are as a whole oppressive. But again, that's only going by my personal definition of oppression. Maybe if you think of oppression as equivalent to sexist, I might agree. I think almost every person holds some sexist beliefs, myself included. I don't consider myself a sexist, because I actively try to suppress these beliefs, but I find myself thinking sexist things sometimes. I think everyone does. So if that's oppression, then everyone is oppressive. But I don't think that's a very good definition of oppression.

Sorry I kinda ranted at you. I promised I wouldn't argue with the other commenter, so I'm kinda using you as a proxy to vent my frustration, haha. But I upvoted you, and largely I agree with you, I just wanted to flesh out my opinions a little :)",t3_34glum,cqv7x46,t1_cqv7a9j,t1_cqv7x46

I had AT&amp;T ADSL for years. My 760 kbps down/128 kbps up connection fall to around 100 kbps both ways. AT&amp;T first tried to claim I was getting 1.5 Mbps via their ""speed test"" then told me I had to replace my old out of warranty ADSL modem with a new $80 one (could get my own for $25 on Amazon). They even tried to convince me that I needed to replace my new TPLink router with their brand to actually get my connection.

I switched to Charter Internet, 60 Mbps down (40 Mbps down usually) and when I canceled they actually tried to play off that ""it was in my best interest"" to switch to their Uverse 3Mbps service. They tried everything to prevent me from canceling service when I'd already removed the modem for a clearly faster service.

TrueChristian,2,0,2,"It sounds to me as though you could use a reminder of God's grace, my friend.  

Remember Romans 8:38-39:

*For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.*

God loves, continues to love, and forgives even through our worst moment.  You are a child of God and this was predetermined -- not by you, but by God -- from before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love (Ephesians 1:4).

I would simply call your attention to two things: first, the parable of the Prodigal Son, particularly Luke 15:32, which reads *""It was meet that we should make merry, and be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was lost, and is found.""* and second, read and be comforted by John 6:37. *""All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.""*  

If you let your circumstance become larger than God's ability to heal that circumstance through His blessing, you'll lose the blessing.  Remember that if you truly wish to lead a better life and live in repentance, know that GOD IS ABLE.  You can't hope to do this in your own strength -- the strength of the world.  Relax, abide in the knowledge that God loves you and wants what is best for you, and depend on Him -- not your own strength -- to see you through.

May God bless and keep you, and peace be with you.",t3_34hee2,cqvg6y4,t3_34hee2,t1_cqvg6y4

Pets,2,0,2,"Thank you. 

It's quite possible that they aren't communicating well. I go to the local VCA Animal Hospital -- they're nothing special, but they're what's close to me. My dog gets car-sick, and I like short drives so I don't get covered in barf and drool. It's probably selfish, but it really sucks when that happens.

I don't know who she saw at the ER this morning, it could have been a vet she saw in the past or not. All the vet's at this place have sort of a rotating ""Who gets ER duty"" schedule. So they are staffed by the same vets she might see for a normal visit, but not necessarily. I wasn't there this morning, I'm just getting information from my boyfriend. He says they told him that she must have ate something funny, and not to worry, and gave her nausea meds, and sent her along.

This bothers me because she doesn't eat funny things. Ever. She has it very cemented in her head that unless an object is clearly given to her, it's not to be touched. This causes her to beg extra hard, but even if I accidentally drop things on the ground, she won't eat it until it's clear I'm allowing her to do so. Sounds silly, probably. She's just not a snarfer. Maybe she snuck something behind my back? I wish my boyfriend had asked for something more, but he's not as worried as I am and was running on an hour of sleep. So that leaves me wondering why the vet didn't think 'Gee, dog's been here a lot, what's up with that?' It is a frustrating series of events. ",t3_34jbwk,cqvge7i,t1_cqvfc2f,t1_cqvge7i

If love is dependent on happiness, then no person will love.  If love stands on its own, then happiness is irrelevant.  Make sense?  If not, we can discuss further elsewhere.

&gt;then why is it so hard for humans to be taught to straight?

I am not an expert on human brains.  I suspect it is along the same reasons why 13yo's from the Jugend happily died facing American soldiers twice their age.  If you look at humanity, most of us do really stupid things that we don't want, even when we know the outcomes.  Why do some women always jump into relationships where they get battered or abused in other ways? And then they jump out of that relationship and jump right back in with a different person who might as well be the same person.

You kinda went on a rant with the rest of your message, there are probably 7-10 new threads there, and you seem really interested in each of them.

Please don't apply that crap to me as it isn't my position.  I really don't care what anyone wants in their lives - if a person wants to be gay or straight or genocidal or caring or argumentative or whatever - I don't care. My concern begins when these things show up on my doorstep, telling me that tolerance to me is forbidden.  My personal beliefs include a simple declaration that sodomy is evil.  I have no position on whether a person is attracted to men or women or kids or rocks or animals or the weird shit that tends to show up at the emergency rooms and so on.

You mention a lot about LGBTetc having emotional problems as they figure themselves out.  My point is that most humans are born with problems.  We can choose to be slaves to them or we can choose to have our problems be slaves to us.

DotA2,1,0,1,"I ignored the agi stats, you are right. Silver makes meepo more tankier, but Scythe is better in overall stats.

Let me review the problems:

* Break no longer works with hex. That makes PA and Bristleback a problem.
* Octarine Core for AoE.

I'm not trying to tell you what to do. I'm just talking out loud my thoughts (well... writing) so maybe we can all make a good 6.84 Meepo meta. I really love Meepo, he is my favorite hero.

About break, if PA is not in the opposite team or if it's doing really bad, then there is no problem, even with evasion she will die pretty fast to 5 meepos.
PA can go battle fury and farm or try to make early ganks. If she goes BF it's pretty easy, she is in jungle waiting for you to gank her.
If she doesn't go BF and is trying to make ganks, that is good news, no AoE crits. Micro low in health meepos away and keep the net so she can't blink to the Meepo.
If you don't win the game fast, PA will get farmed. So how to deal with a farmed PA. Silver Edge is a killer, cause it takes not only evasion, but also crits. Without crits and with 40% less damage it's a killer for her.
My math says it's 65% damage reduction. If she normally does 100 damage, with crits she will do 167.5 average or 450 when crits procs. With Silver Edge she will do 60 damage with no procs.
That is 3.25 of complete damage disable, pretty close to Scythe.

If you have more counters in the other team (like an earthshaker), Silver Edge doesn't work with them. That is true. You now need more than 1 disable in some cases.
There are some items in Meepo that I wouldn't take away ever. Aghs, blink, Skadi and BoT. [Looking the chart of survival](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=416433583) the Skadi is pretty near to a heart.


That leaves 2 slots, one must be a disable. If there is PA and she is farmed/good then you need both to be disables. One silence and one break.
You can also try a Radiance vs PA. I did very little tests but in all of them it worked pretty well, she can't evade the burn and a lot of meepos hitting her will still do damage, poof is magical and the 17% miss chance is pretty nice.
If PA is crashing your team in early/mid game you may need to go for a silver edge as a first disable, it's not good but you don't have much choice. If I'm forced to go Silver Edge as a first disable and are some casters to take, I will go for an Orchid. Lower cooldown, longer duration and cheaper. I will never go for an orchid if I don't need to buy the Silver Edge as it gives worthless stats to Meepo.


So against casters. How I see it it's basically: who stuns the other fist wins. Most of them are no different than before. You blink, silence/hex then and kill them. The only one that I think will be different are Bristleback and Leshrac.
Leshrac can keep it's spells going even if he is silence. Bristleback is physical damage and requieres break to be killed.
I have no idea how to deal with leshrac ulti.

They can also tell by the TTL of your packets.

There are tons of ways to tell. For instance if your android device has frequent connections to microsoft update servers or apple's app store.

That's not to say sprint is using all or any of those methods.

How do you get around it? TOR or a VPN. 

FYI if you haven't looked into it, it's super easy to set up your own VPN. I rent a virtual server for $5 a month (digitalocean but there's tons of companies out there that offer these), I installed OpenVPN on it, and I installed the OpenVPN Connect client on my android. The app walks you through setup, and start to finish with a little linux knowledge you could have it done in 20 minutes easily. 

Now all my traffic flows through my VPN and my wireless carrier can fuck off. 

At work, I do have to disable it or I get booted automatically off my company's wifi. This is a risk management measure for my company. Outbound VPN connections are a possible indicator of malicious activity. ",t3_34l6dn,cqvt7ya,t3_34l6dn,t1_cqvt7ya

I realize not all techs are out to get me, I just like having as much information available as possible and the fact that the first CSR I spoke to did not mention a fee of $50 for the tech visit but then I received an email confirming the $50 fee for a failed SIK:

&gt;One-Time Installation Charges	 
Failed CHSI Sik
$50.00

At this point, the next CSR I chatted with said that no matter what, they're charging for a tech to come out. This is interesting to me because they don't know the problem, so how can they bill for it?

Anywho, I've reviewed the link you provided and it was something I found in another forum online and reviewed. Just for completeness, as I realize I forgot to include it in the OP (I'll edit it in to the album linked above) but [here](http://imgur.com/OwhMHjO) is the power levels and SNR for my preferred modem (the dpc3008). Interestingly enough, it would appear that I am locked out of some of the settings on the modem such as viewing the logs as the default user/password of &lt;blank&gt;/&lt;blank&gt; doesn't allow me to view any additional tabs.

In either case, my Power Level seems acceptable and the SNR is borderline but within acceptable limits (I believe). I'm not sure why, at this time, I'm only bonded to 1/4 Upstream channels, but that appears to fluctuate as well as, at various times I've found myself bonded to more than 1 channel on all of the modems I own.

Just to step through some of the other items from the link you provided:

* My lease time is currently 4 days, May 2- May 6 so no work appears to be actively being performed

* The [comcast speed test](http://speedtest.comcast.net/) says my recommended server is Miami, FL even though I'm in Bellingham, WA. Additionally, speedtest.net puts me in Nebraska-ish for their default server (looks like both are powered by OOKLA). This seems odd to me. [Here](http://results.speedtest.comcast.net/result/889728004.png) were the results of said speed test when I scrolled over to the Seattle Server.

* I have disabled all firewalls on my machine, run Windows 8.1 on my home computer and Windows 7 on my corporate issued laptop maintained by their own corporate IT policy.


I'll be sure to chat with the tech and provide any information that they deem relevant to investigating this issue. If the work is indeed within the house and I sign up for the SPP with the tech, would I basically be looking at $10 instead of $50 assuming I keep the SPP for 2 months, or would it be $50+10?

I Appreciate your help and input not just for this but for [all the help you've provided over the years](http://forums.comcast.com/t5/Basic-Internet-Connectivity-And/Problems-with-Cisco-dpc3008-dropping-connections/td-p/1254989).

politics,6,0,6,"Democrats (except for Dixiecrats on civil rights issues) were 'liberal' starting in the 50's when the party started shifting in favor of civil rights, etc, and during the 60's, 70's, and 80's. Kennedy, Johnson, and Carter were elected, all Democrats. Eisenhower could've been either a Democrat or Republican, really, though he apparently had issues with the Democratic Party. 

Carter's Presidency sorta sunk what popularity the Democrats had left (the Democratic Party was seen as weak, indecisive, and ineffectual), and opened the door to a revamped Republican Party led by Reagan. Starting at that point, the Democrats started abandoning their more left-wing principles and started shifting toward the middle. Now. . .Reagan could be a moderate or right-of-center Democrat today, at least in certain aspects. Eisenhower would probably be a Democrat. Nixon would be a Democrat. The Democratic Party changed from a more left-wing party to a party dominated by centrists and featuring a few left-wing folks from areas like the California coast, New England, Minnesota, and wherever a left-winger is determined to be 'electable'.",t3_34ml0q,cqwp7o3,t1_cqw9ehc,t1_cqwp7o3

I have no idea what to say except I'm still not buying it. Someone with ten years of experience as a CIO can easily get an IT job. The IT market is on fire, especially for senior talent. I'm getting recruiters calling me all the time looking for folks.

If you really do need a job, just look at central Ohio. You shouldn't have a problem finding a job that pays well here.

There is only one rule. Donate $1 to the winner. Some donate more, which is nice. Too many donate less, which is the issue I am addressing. For legal reasons donating isn't a hard and fast rule. It is simply a gentlemen's agreement between those who are trying to achieve a goal. If we all pitch in and donate as we are supposed to, we should have no problem attracting people to the subreddit.

ukpolitics,1,0,1,"&gt; Only a third of the population actually vote for his party's candidates though - two thirds of voters would rather someone else.

Yes, that's true, but I don't see the problem. The Conservatives got more votes than any other party, and therefore are in government. How can that possibly be ""wrong""? It is the job of the electorate to decide who will be in government next, and more people wanted the Conservatives in power than any other party - you can't vote for ""not the Tories"", because that makes no sense in the context of this question. The point of an election is to allow a new government to be chosen, and if that doesn't happen for whatever reason, then the system has failed.

&gt; It's not UKIP or the Green Party's fault that because they tackle big issues which are relevant to people across the country, they are equally appealing across the country rather than specifically concentrating in a particular area (with the exceptions of Brighton and the places where personal vote wins for UKIP).

The primary job of an MP is to represent their constituencies in Parliament - everything else comes secondary to that. The job of UKIP and the Greens is to convince constituents that their MP would best represent them, in exactly the same way as it is the Conservatives', Labour's and the Lib Dem's job to do likewise. It's nothing to do with ""tackling the big issues"" - all the major parties has policies on areas such as immigration, climate change and the economy. But if you start fighting an election without giving any consideration to local representation and trying to appeal to the population as a whole, then you're bound to fail.

&gt; Nor is it their fault that because FPTP necessitates tactical voting, people choose to vote for the Conservative candidate out of fear that a vote for UKIP will allow the Labour candidate to win.

Tactical voting only works when enough people participate in it. If people just voted for the MP that they prefer most, then the outcome would be a lot more representative of the views of the constituents, and would also allow ""minor"" or ""fringe"" parties to gradually build-up support. Tactical voting is not a fault of the system - it is the choice of the electorate. Furthermore, tactical voting exists in any sort voting system - even PR - in various different forms and to various degrees.

&gt; FPTP is an utterly failed system, and the sooner it changes the better.

Like I've already said, the point of an election is choose the next government, and a government is inherently more effective when allowed to rule as a majority rather than as part of a coalition. The mark of it's success, I believe, is that this is the first coalition government we've had in the last 70 years.",t3_34muvs,cqwvteu,t1_cqwlqqn,t1_cqwvteu

SchoolIdolFestival,1,0,1,"Actually, I think it's very possible for you to T1. I managed to T1 the recent Maki Event, and I was only rank 59.  I had half the amount of love gems you do right now.

A surefire way to give you a boost for the rest of the event is to use most of your love gems at the beginning (first 2 days), boosting you up high in the rankings, and keeping you safe for a few days. It's the best strategy. You can then play normally for most of the event and use maybe 1 love gem/day or whenever you need to. Nearing the end, people will start pouring their love gems in so that's where you need to start playing seriously again.


I can give you exact calculations on how much you need to play when the event begins. Last Maki Event cutoff was about 68-69k points ( i overshot and ended up with 72k) so we assume that the cutoff is near that, a bit lower since the tiers might expand. Just give me your level of playing: S/S Hard or B/A EX or S/S EX (etc.) and I can calculate how much you need to play. This is likely to change when the event begins, though, depending on how popular Umi really is.",t3_34dcel,cqxblaq,t1_cqws507,t1_cqxblaq

No matter what Eli did, he couldn't please them.

The talk was about ""oh, the endorsements are better in NYC"" which is true, but they're better because you can get involved in the community and build something. 

You can tell a lot about the culture of a team by their community involvement.

rpg,3,0,3,"I tried this a long time back and it was hella fun, but I made the mistake of having each hero be about as cool as Terry's supersuit.


Do not do that. The heroes-in-total need to be about as cool as the villains, and a solo villain should be able to handle the entire group (more or less) for a little while on their own.


Don't use any system that's very crunchy. Try to focus on the story and the action descriptions rather than the mechanics that lead up to having a rating + die roll.

A game that doesn't focus so much on the power levels would be best. Something like 4CC! The Hero's Handbook. Or Savage Worlds (Super Powers companion / Necessary Evil) or one of the simpler FATE games.

They are queuing together because they obviously mesh well with each other and/or they have known each other for a long time. That's a strategic advantage over a 2-3 party MM team.

InternetIsBeautiful,1,0,1,"Naturally, how a contract is to be enforced is one of many questions that *should* be specified in a contract itself; that is an important part of any agreement.

Indeed, a dispute occurs when there is not a clear contract. After all, a game cannot be played well until rules have been defined and accepted beforehand—and it certainly cannot be played well when rules are constructed and *imposed* (by some third party, no less) while the game is being played, especially when those new rules contradict old rules.

In particular, why should one organization have a self-declared, violently imposed monopoly over the industry of contract enforcement? Perhaps justice, like the product of any other industry, would be honed to perfection through the cooperative practice known as ""competition"". After all, governments (at least at the level of ""nations"", but also to various degrees at the level of towns, cities, counties, provinces, states, and so on) have hitherto always existed within such a competitive anarchy—there has never existed a world government.

So, each person operates under the law that he and his associates construct through agreements both explicit and implicit; in this way, law transcends geography, and becomes a matter of personal history. Note, again, that this is not terribly different from what exists today and what has long existed already: One person's contractual obligations are never the same as another's.

As a result, I cannot tell you how such a society would be structured—or even how it *should* be structured beyond the highest levels of abstraction. Its order would emerge from variation and selection, without anybody necessarily realizing that solutions to complex problems are being forged; evolution does not require intelligent design.",t3_34lvnh,cqxwutv,t1_cqxlln0,t1_cqxwutv

FFRecordKeeper,2,0,2,"Not game breaker, sure, but it's a good way of making weak characters hit hard without spending abilities/magic. I have been using it on bosses lately simply because I have 1 mage (Terra), who handles attack (2x Comet) and Cure (6x Curaga). I keep Comet 1 per boss, and then she turns useless, unless I use retaliate, where she hits hard, Cyan hists hard, and if the boss hits Cyan, he hits hard again.

Not only that, you can make characters on the back row hit hard and get less damage at the same time, for that you need a retaliate tanker, but good equip can achieve that.

Now think like this, you have 4 Retaliate uses, a certain event has 4 battles, you start with retaliate and 4 mages gets to hit hard, and Retaliate keeps going each round. When you get to the Boss Battle, you have tons of powerful magic to use. That's kinda game breaking if you think about it. But sure, we still don't have enough specialized team members to use something like this efficiently, and we can just tank everyone and hit hard with our main attackers like Cloud, Sephy, Cecils, Tidus, Cyan and Josef.

Another thing, in my situation right now, I have 4 strikers, but only 3 are efficient, basically, Wakka has a shitty weapon. He can kill weak enemies, but on bosses, I can just increase his attack by also using the Retaliate trick with him (173 Attack with Wakka compared to 217 from Cyan).",t3_34szmq,cqxxa4i,t1_cqxvd3c,t1_cqxxa4i

Considering the great strides in 3D printing techniques, automation, pre-fabrication, and other technological advancements, the fact that construction and maintenance are still so incredibly slow and expensive, and that entire massive infrastructure projects and resources are all left to rot or dwindle is the biggest waste of time, money and energy I can think of.  The Cincinnati Subway Tunnels are one such example; the need to jackhammer up entire sheets of concrete or other road material every time a water main breaks is another.

A way to modernize and maintain infrastructure would not only benefit the revitalization of infrastructure in developed countries, but aid the establishment and development of infrastructure in developing ones.

gameofthrones,6,0,6,"I don't care about deviations from the books, I'm just completely baffled at this sub-reddit and reviewers inability to perceive that this season, unlike the previous four, is bad.  It's quantitatively bad. Maybe it will get better (I hope so).
     
I saw a grantland article yesterday saying this is ""the best season yet"". It baffles my mind. I love Game of Thrones, but even just dissecting one aspect, the dialogue, and you can see the huge drop. I rewatched seasons 1-4 before starting 5, and it was incredibly salient.        

I'm not some against the grain contrarian, I love being on the GoT bandwagon and cheering it on. I love good tv. I don't care about ""your sister"" instead of ""only cat"" nitpicking, I thought season 4 was great even if they botched the sept rape scene, etc., but this season stinks.      
       
That said, I wouldn't hang my hat on this scene. He's never seemed overly important to the story. Given how much others speak of his combat prowess, I did want to see him fight just once in the show. His fight was pretty good. Cutting that guy in half from balls to brains was a cool move. The fight wasn't amazing by any stretch of the imagination, but it was solid. My guess is he didn't wear armor because the actor is old and doing all those moves in armor would have been impossible.      
      
Also, are we sure he's dead? He's about to get his throat slit and Grey Worm saves him. It didn't seem conclusive either had died.",t3_34tqjn,cqycu6t,t3_34tqjn,t1_cqycu6t

My comment was not vitriolic, I thanked him for his imput but rejected his request to see my decklist. Yes I was defensive, but I felt like he was attacking my deck without cause. Yes I am proud of my deck but I don't think my pride is excessive for not wanting internet strangers to pick it apart. I know it could be improved, I just don't have the money or the cards to do that at the moment.

Also I have no clue why you thought I was ""uppity"". Doesn't that imply that I am somehow below you or others here and that by being proud my admittedly non-pro-level deck I am above my station?

I refused off topic criticisms, not constructive help. Telling me my deck is innefficient doesn't help against Hornet Queen. If I wanted a full-deck critique I would have posted my decklist and asked for one. My deck is obviously still not complete and still undergoes frequent changes.

Nowhere did I criticise people who play expensive decks or even popular decks.

TinyHouses,3,0,3,"My advice would be to keep looking. You're not technically supposed to live in a tiny house (or RV) even on your own land in most areas, and you don't want to buy the land and then find out the authorities won't let you stay there. Also, if you're only going to be in the area for three years, and you're going to be working and travelling for work, you're not gonna have much time for the build.
I'm building a tiny house right now, and none of it's hard, but there's so damn many things to do! And every single thing takes time.
A couple suggestions. First, I'd keep looking in the area and look for a small fixer-upper. Move in, do some work on it, and you'll get a feel for how much you like this kind of work before committing to a build. If you still want to go forward with the build, having a house on the property makes you pretty much bulletproof from anyone complaining about you living in a tiny house where it isn't allowed. Anyone complains, you just say, naw, I'm living in the house, I'm building this for kicks. There's no hurry to finish, you don't have to deal with building a garage, et cetera. You could even rent the main house when your tiny house is liveable. 
If that option doesn't appeal to you, have the garage built first. Choose a garage plan with a loft space you can finish up and live in. If you still want to build the tiny house, then you can be living on site and have a place to work outside of the weather. The alternative, having to rent somewhere to stay while you're building the tiny house, and have to commute to your build location, move tools back and forth and stuff... it's a major nuisance.
I think reselling a piece of land with a nice garage on it would be easier than selling unimproved land. A lot of people dream of building their own home, and finding a property with a nice garage or pole barn with power to it already, it makes achieving their dream easier.

You can preallocate resources at startup or in a service and put handles in for different memory pressures so you are kind in releasing things when something else needs memory.

A smart way to do it is often to load the ui activity when you add a notification, since its a good chance that the user is going to launch your main bits soon after.  Pretty sure gmail does this.

DarkSouls2,7,0,7,"ALRIGHTY. First things first.

Get the Fire Longsword from Forest of Fallen Giants. To be frank, you're going to be using this for a good chunk of the game, and in a lot of situations it's safer to just whip out your sword and stab some dudes than to try and cast a spell. Pump INT and FTH to 20. Start making your way to Huntsman's Copse after beating Heide's Tower of Flame (it's the alternate path Licia will open for you). There will be an NPC near the end of the cave. Talk to him, and he'll give you the Hexer's Set. The hood is fugly, but you'll be wearing it for most of the game, because it increases how many casts you have, and gives you a +1 bonus to INT and FTH. It's super fucking good.

Next up. You have two areas you want to beat, use a Bonfire Ascetic on, and re-clear. The first is the Shaded Ruins area of the Shaded Woods, to kill Scorpioness Najka. She'll drop the Southern Ritual Band +2 which gives you 3 more attunement slots. In addition, there's a chest behind a petrified statue on the way up here that drops the Lion Mage set, which is also fugly as sin but increases your casting speed by a noticeable amount. The second is in the Huntsman's Copse, where you kill the Skeleton Lords. The Lords will drop a Clear Bluestone Ring +2, which massively ups your casting speed.

As far as which brand of magic you want to go to, it honestly depends on your personal preferences. 

Hexes do good damage, have good debuffs, and a good amount of versatility. However, they require both INT and FTH to cast. This is an issue because for most of the game you can't pump INT and FTH high enough while maintaining enough spare points for the other stuff you need. The end result is that hexers are either glass cannons, or lack the stats to equip many useful weapons like the Crypt Blacksword. This isn't as big an issue for something like SL 200, though. In addition, some hexes can take up a *lot* of attunement slots (as many as 4(!) for one spell), and different hexes require different types of catalysts.

Sorceries have a lot of versatility, utility, and a LOT of different spells. In addition, some specific sorceries are the most damaging types of spells in the entire game. The utility is pretty nice, too, giving you things like reduced fall damage, the ability to repair weapons, silence your footsteps, etc. On the down side, a lot of sorcieries are situational at best/useless at worst, and the INT requirements are insanely high for the end-game stuff, reaching into the 50s-60s for some spells/equipment. In addition, the best sorcery catalyst can't cast hexes (i.e. not as versatile). To make matters worse, that same catalyst casts spells higher than others, with the end result being that in melee range, it's not unheard of to send spells flying over your enemy's head.

Miracles are more support-oriented spells. They offer great healing spells for both yourself and others in co-op, some of the best self-buffs in the game, and great utility spells like Emit Force. While there are a few offensive miracles, they've mostly been nerfed to uselessness, so you'll need to invest points into another source of offense as well. Don't expect to dump everything into FTH and go around smiting people with lightning bolts.

Finally, pyromancies are unique in that they require *no* stat investment to use. While they do scale off INT and FTH, they're mainly used by melee characters looking to add a non-physical source of damage to their kit. Don't scoff at pyros, though. They offer great (if short-range) damage, some respectable self-buffs, and a decent healing spell (that's vital for fight clubs).",t3_34wvih,cqyujyy,t3_34wvih,t1_cqyujyy

Now is that Keyblade Roxas' or Ventus'? 

I think that it's Roxas' since Ventus' default Keyblade is the Wayward Wind, but there's also something else to consider. Apparently, [Nobodies can grow hearts, meaning that Roxas most likely has one](/spoiler). This means that Roxas could in fact be using his own Keyblade and not Ventus' since Ventus' heart could perform the ceremony on Roxas.

Xion herself doesn't seem to be using a real Keyblade- Riku called it a ""sham,"" so maybe it's designed to harvest hearts but isn't the real deal. Maybe at some point she [grows her own heart too and gets her own,](/spoiler) but I'm not convinced (we'd need more evidence).

chicagobulls,2,0,2,"&gt; Hot Shooting

&gt; We shot 52% from the field in the first half and still only led by five at half, and only had 4 turnovers. That speaks to how gifted the cavs are even without love, and Kyrie is a beast. We should have been up by more but they got some offensive boards which hurt us. 

I rewatched the game and saw we missed a TON of easy buckets which could have had our lead a bit more comfortable, minor mistakes, a few air balls from jimmy, a bad miss by noah and FREE THROWS. Those are things we need to work on, simple fundamental plays and we're solid. I honestly don't think the Cavs have enough firepower to keep up with us, even if we have just 4 of our 8 guys having a good night.

&gt; Shump

&gt; Dude shot 10 threes, and hit 4, and had 22 points. I mean I don't think he can keep up that level of production for a whole series which bodes well for the bulls.

I am really curious to see where the Cavs will find their offense. Shump had a good game, without his 22pts this game would've been a blow out. I don't see him knocking out a lot of 3s this series. Miller is on his last leg, Marion can't score, Dellavedova is 24 but plays like a 34 year old Kirk. It's going to take Kyrie and Lebron having to score 35-40 each to really stand a chance against us and you know we'll be pressuring the hell out of them so they're really going to have to work for their points.

I know and expect the Cavs to come out stronger next game, but I think we've learned from the past and will be able to capitalize and preemptively put up a wall to stop them. Ball movement was great and we had defensive stops when we needed to.

Also known as the pavilion, in modern usage the umbraculum is a symbol of the Roman Catholic Church and the authority of the Pope over it. It is found in the contemporary Church at all the basilicas throughout the world, placed prominently at the right of their main altars. Whenever the Pope visits a basilica, its umbraculum is opened.

To Phillip Rogaway, a professor of computer science at the University of California, Davis, keyword-search is probably the “least of our problems.” In an email to The Intercept, Rogaway warned that “When the NSA identifies someone as ‘interesting’ based on contemporary NLP [Natural Language Processing] methods, it might be that there is no human-understandable explanation as to why beyond: ‘his corpus of discourse resembles those of others whom we thought interesting'; or the conceptual opposite: ‘his discourse looks or sounds different from most people’s.'”

If the algorithms NSA computers use to identify threats are too complex for humans to understand, Rogaway wrote, “it will be impossible to understand the contours of the surveillance apparatus by which one is judged.  All that people will be able to do is to try your best to behave just like everyone else.”",t3_34y8mw,cqz7on8,t3_34y8mw,t1_cqz7on8

They may be clowns, but they are clowns because a large hunk of the country is clowns.  There's enough of them that if the Dems don't put their best foot forward one of them could slide in. 

I would prefer Sanders but we can't take a chance.  Not with how radically right Republicans have run.  If one of them gets back in the white house its gonna be a shitshow.  These aint your daddy's republicans.  Any kind of social or economic progress we've made will be driven in reverse at 100 miles an hour and crashed into a wal-mart.  the only thing stopping this dumbass congress from running us into the ground is that they don't control the white house.

republicans have gerrymandered the shit out of the country and only old people vote in midterms so they've got a pretty decent deathgrip on congress. if they get both branches you can kiss any kind of progress goodbye

&gt; The bees you should be concerned about are the 3,999 other bee species living in North America, most of which are solitary, stingless, ground-nesting bees you&amp;#039;ve never heard of.

&gt; A whole host of little blueberry bees, squash bees, and orchard bees co-evolved with many of our fruits and vegetables.

&gt; &amp;quot;Our native bees, so vitally important in our ecosystems, are more sensitive to pesticides. Any person who has even a postage stamp yard can stop using pesticides, put in more native plants, and leave some wild areas for bees to to nest in the ground. It is that easy to help make a difference.""

They will have the same access to the subreddit and similar right to post.

The moral of the story is you are the best person to help the subreddit become what you want it to become by contributing rather than walking in one day and demanding why this community isn't what you wanted.

UBC,1,0,1,"&gt;I'm interested in doing a minor in computer science mainly because I think it would open up more career options, especially for tech jobs in the Vancouver area. Would this be a valid reasoning?

Sure. Unless you're already in computer engineering, then it wouldn't make much sense.

&gt;Based on that, should I try to get exemptions for all introductory courses (CPSC110, 121, 210 I think?) and skip straight to algo design and data structures? Or is that a really bad idea?

Are any of the courses you've already taken are on the credit [exclusion list?](http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,215,410,414) As far as I know, there are no challenge exams for 121 and 210. If you don't have a cross-listed course in the credit exclusion list, then you'll need to take them since they're prerequisites for everything else.

&gt;Maybe should I attempt the challenge exam and see how that goes first? Does anyone know if I have to pay for it?

You can attempt it. Info is [here.](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/undergrad/courses-deadlines/cpsc-110-challenge-exam)

&gt;Assuming I got all that and the other pre-reqs sorted out, what would be some useful and interesting 300, 400 level CPSC courses to take?

Read the course descriptions in the ssc. Do any of the upper-levels stand out to you? If you want the same knowledge base as cpsc majors, then 310, 313, and 320 are required courses. 304 is databases, which for industry is a de facto required course. If you want more dev experience then take 319 and 410. Just make sure you have all the prereqs.

And, as always, speak to an adviser before deciding anything.",t3_34x7pu,cqztigj,t3_34x7pu,t1_cqztigj

PersonalFinanceCanada,1,0,1,"It's a good idea to diversify geographically, and the US does have pretty much the biggest selection for investments. It's definitely a good idea to buy into the US.

If you insist on picking stocks (as opposed to other investments like index funds), look into a brokerage that will hold USD in your RRSP. In order to buy, you'll need to convert your CAD to USD, which is usually a very simple process. 

Since the broker in this case will hold USD, there's no need to worry about currency conversion, which does cost you a small amount, unless you're putting money in or taking it out. Dividends and proceeds from sales will be paid into the USD balance.  

I have an RRSP with VirtualBrokers that allows me to hold USD. It costs $15USD/quarter though. You can buy stocks for $.01/share, which is fantastically cheap if you're buying small amounts.  That said, I've had problems with their support being unresponsive and others have as well. You should always consider the pros and cons of each brokerage before you pick, and be sure to check out what others say about them on the Internet.

There are always currency risks when trading in other markets, but even if you stay in Canada, you'll be indirectly exposed to those through the companies you buy, most of whom have overseas business.  The currency risks are much lower than the risks of putting all your eggs in the Canadian market basket, in my opinion.

summonerschool,2,0,2,"if you want to know how to do support as alistar in normals, read below, if only for aram, skip to teamfight role which is indented

there are 2 ways to play alistar in lane, aggressive or passive

aggressive- get relic shield, look for the WQ combo (will explain in a sec) and max Q first for intial burst, since your cc is pretty powerful early, you will win trades, however, you run out of mana pretty quicly

passive- its actually what i usually do since I dont like to go all in as supports early on, start gold coin, max E but get a point in Q and W early, us the Q and W for zoning and reingage purposes, with E, you should be able to keep your side healthy

so the way you build ali, is prob the first item (after sightstone of course) is righteous glory, engage power gives u a nice spike in the mid game, mana for ur high mana costs, and health to work with your ult (remember that without resistances, with ult u are still really tank) then go probalby frozen heart for cd and aura  into other tank items

&gt; teamfight role: zoning out enemy carries or peeling for your own, alistar is very good at both of these roles, dont be afraid to tank turrets if u have ult up, you Q is a really good disrupt while W'ing a tank like sej will make her life miserable

&gt; in aram, teams are more poke reliant, if you want to go tank, after getting a point in Q and W, max E to keep your team healthy from poke, use the WQ combo to engage as necessary, if going dmg, max Q so you get the aoe teamfight burst, with your ult dont be scared to go in if your team can follow up, unfortunately, ali is somewat weak in aram cuz he has no poke 

&gt; the WQ combo goes like this, you have to know the range of your W and cast it at max range for this to work, basically how you do it is that you cast W and almost immediately after casting W, press Q, what this does is that the W will bring you into range on the enemy team, yet your Q has a slight cast time, so by casting it as your W brings you into the team, the Q will cast as your W hits

&gt;what does this mean? this means that the W will hit the enemy back, but the knock up for Q will hit, so you get a free gapcloser into a knock up, so a mini malphite ult, you can still do this by casting Q after, but you will push the person you targeted away, so this WQ combo lets you solo people out and catch them where you would be unable to do otherwise since the W pushes hm away and the Q will not be in range

btw, one misconception you have is that alistar only headbutts to push people into your team, its not, its an engage/zone tool with many uses, its not just a bad lee sin combo, but you still can do it, if you can Q someone, walk around and W, go for it, just those opportunities dont show up often, specially in aram

hope this helps

WTF,2,0,2,"&gt; everyone who has survived a suicide attempt from jumping has stated they immediately regretted it after jumping

[Source, for anyone interested:](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2003/10/13/jumpers)

&gt; Survivors often regret their decision in midair, if not before. Ken Baldwin and Kevin Hines both say they hurdled over the railing, afraid that if they stood on the chord they might lose their courage. Baldwin was twenty-eight and severely depressed on the August day in 1985 when he told his wife not to expect him home till late. “I wanted to disappear,” he said. “So the Golden Gate was the spot. I’d heard that the water just sweeps you under.” On the bridge, Baldwin counted to ten and stayed frozen. He counted to ten again, then vaulted over. “I still see my hands coming off the railing,” he said. As he crossed the chord in flight, Baldwin recalls, “I instantly realized that everything in my life that I’d thought was unfixable was totally fixable—except for having just jumped.”

&gt; Kevin Hines was eighteen when he took a municipal bus to the bridge one day in September, 2000. After treating himself to a last meal of Starbursts and Skittles, he paced back and forth and sobbed on the bridge walkway for half an hour. No one asked him what was wrong. A beautiful German tourist approached, handed him her camera, and asked him to take her picture, which he did. “I was like, ‘Fuck this, nobody cares,’ ” he told me. “So I jumped.” But after he crossed the chord, he recalls, “My first thought was What the hell did I just do? I don’t want to die.”

Backcountry,1,0,1,"It sounds to me like you might consider sticking to lightweight tele gear, but just get a better setup.  The reason you've struggled going down with cross country skis is that you're using cross country skis.  I started out in a similar way to what you describe, and the kind of skiing that I prefer is also similar.  When I finally tried actual tele skis instead of XC, it was a revelation.  I could actually turn and enjoy it!  

One good reason to go that way is that it is really cheap.  The setup I use the most cost me 40 bucks for [skis and bindings](http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/karhu-special-telemark-skis-rotefella-130710773) used in good shape.  I paid $150 for the [boots](http://www.sierratradingpost.com/garmont-excursion-telemark-ski-boots-with-g-fit-liner-for-men~p~72714/) because I wanted something that would fit well and I wasn't finding it used.  The setup works great in pretty much all conditions.  

I've used randonée gear for backcountry touring and I wasn't impressed.  It was heavy and a pain to lock and unlock the heal.  Maybe it was the gear I was using, which was cheap and borrowed.  I suspect that the newer more expensive bindings work better, but I don't see the value in going that route.  

I would look for skis that have at least a little bit of shape to them, and are relatively short, like 165-170cm or even shorter.  Look for lightweight.  The best brands I've used are Karhu, Tua and Atomic.  Cable bindings by Rotefella or Voile are good, and I like the Garmont boots but Scarpa T2s are easy to find and relatively cheap most of the time.  Good luck!",t3_3500ci,cr0640i,t3_3500ci,t1_cr0640i

He tried to hit me once more for spite before he left the bus, but the bitch missed and hit a girl in front of me.

Now I'm a stoic and pragmatic person and I believe that the life of worry is a short life so not many things can get to me. But my God do I feel bad in hindsight that I didn't slapped the shit out of that kid. And I mean slapped until he starts crying so all of his friends can see.

I've never seen a entitled little brat in my life before that encounter. 
And if that ever happens to me I will slap a little shits like that until police comes. I don't care. I won't go to prison, I won't have any problems because of it, and the cops will probably side with me all the way. But you can better believe that when that little cunt's parents gets called to the station to pick up their son, there will be hell to pay.

ballpython,2,0,2,"I personally dislike using generalizations and hyperboles on this topic. I find phrases such as ""do not feed your ball python in its home enclosure unless youre perfectly fine with never holding it"" can be inaccurate and misleading. 

I also feel you'd be hard-pressed to find ""THOUSANDS"" of breeders out there publicly advocating either system, but nowadays advocating feeding within the enclosure appears more common. I say this based on 2 years of interactions in the Ball-Pythons.net discussion boards. I trust this source because, unlike webpages which can fall out of date, the forum contains current information with input from multiple reputable breeders active in their field, as well as many other BP owners providing their own perspectives and experience. 

After 2 years, the most common response I've seen is a very well reasoned ""Do what works best for you in your situation. BUT, feeding inside the enclosure accompanied by regular handling is no longer believed to cause cage aggression"". In fact, [here's a timely discussion on the topic ](http://ball-pythons.net/forums/showthread.php?225576-Feeding-in-a-serparate-bin-cage-container&amp;highlight=feeding+enclosure) from just last week. But if you don't believe me, go ask them yourself! 

Now it seems the majority of BP owners on BP.net feed inside their enclosures. Some, like Chairman-Meeow above, don't. But they feed outside the enclosure for reasons other than cage aggression - mostly associated with cleanliness, hygiene, observing live-feeding, etc. I would not advise feeding outside the enclosure on the sole basis of ""avoiding aggression"". By the same premise, why risk stressing your snake or injuring yourself by moving them out of a feeding box too soon? 

I myself feed inside the enclosure. My girl has never rejected food and has a great feeding response. I also give her weekly handlings. She has never once attempted to eat me. I suppose she recognizes the difference between person-sized prime rib and actual prime rib? I could imagine never, ever handling your BP and only interacting with them at feeding times could eventually produce aggression. But this could be as much a product of never socializing your snake as so-called ""feeding aggression"". 

Anyways, new owners should be provided with resources such as trusted caresheets and BP.net and then given the opportunity to decide for themselves. I see below you say ""if it works it works"" and I would agree more with that sentiment than any of your comments above.  ",t3_34zczm,cr0fhm6,t1_cr0bgzd,t1_cr0fhm6

AskReddit,3,0,3,"I'm on the 6+, so battery life is more or less comparable, and I charge with an iPad charger so I'm nailing down fast-charging as well.

I'm not saying the S6 isn't a nice phone - it's a fine phone on paper. It's comparable to the iPhone, has a remarkably similar design, and it is similar in price. I haven't used it personally, so it's hard for me to say that it is markedly better in any big way, but to act like the iPhone has some large price inflation for ""status"" is silly when the true difference in price and general specs between the devices is so damn small.

And given that these devices hit more-or-less price parity, it's not really a money issue.

The little things that apple does right? Those are the differentiators for me. I was burned by one crappy android phone after android phone before making the switch, and at this point, I'm sold on the apple ecosystem. Maybe the S6 would have finally been the android phone that made me happy with my experience, but I won't find out, because I'm absolutely 100% satisfied with my 6+.

Now, a year or two down the line, all bets are off. If android is putting up a product worth looking at, I'll look at it. When I bought my 6+, there was no S6. The only android phone worth looking at when I bought my 6+ was the note 4, and I liked the 6+ better in almost every way. If the S6 existed at that time, I would have genuinely considered it.

That said, I'll admit it's going to be hard not to just jump on whatever new iPhone is out at that time. Apple has done a great job of integrating its devices so that each one adds to the usefulness of the set. I get the sense the next iPhone will be, as usual, at or very near the top of its class, and I won't feel bad about buying one.

Understand though, I'm rooted in Apple now. I run my entire business off a macbook and apple has won me over with rock-solid reliability, extremely high-end security (file vault 2, dead simple wireless time machine, easy to use OS (windows 8 was a mess, although 10 may correct things), built-in and completely effort-free resistance to viruses/keyloggers/etc), amazing battery life, and extremely high build quality. I can't imagine going back to a windows machine for the work I do (I run a small publishing house and I'm an author myself). That made switching to an iPhone an even more appealing choice, and one that so far, I haven't regretted for a single moment. There hasn't been one time that I looked at my phone and was upset about how it was operating. This is the first cellphone I've been TRULY happy with. It's the first phone I've owned where I haven't said ""boy, I wish it could do _____"" or, ""damn, I wish this thing was faster"", or ""I wish it had a bigger screen"" or, ""I wish the battery lasted longer"", or ""why the hell is my phone turning into molten lava in my pocket?"". I've had everything since the damn startac, so this is a big deal.

&gt; Chicago approved an unprecedented deal on Wednesday to compensate victims tortured in police custody in the 1970s and 80s under the regime of a notorious former police commander, in an attempt to close a dark chapter in the city&amp;#039;s history.

&gt; Chicago city council voted to award a total of $5.5m to help survivors, almost all African American men, who were mistreated in a long episode of police brutality that ran throughout the 70s and 80s under Jon Burge.

&gt; Pressure has mounted on Emanuel to confront police violence as reports in the Guardian about a secretive Chicago police facility known as Homan Square collided with activism around the Burge torture regime during his mayoral runoff election.

What Wuyu doesnt know is that his corpse puppet becoming sentient at yuanying stage is not some freak accident, as Ye Zizai's corpse puppet, Luocha, is also sentient and slowly consuming him. Not only that, but Luocha refers to Wuyu's corpse puppet as ""Master Zi"" and wants Ye Zizai to go help the corpse puppet consume Wuyu.

Straight weight loss is simple - consume less than you use. You create the deficit by cutting calories from your diet and/ or burning extra calories with exercise. You are not doomed if you consume a few extra calories or have a cheat day. If you have already lost weight, keep doing what you are doing and you'll continue to make progress.  

In terms of specific exercise.... You can't choose where you lose fat from, but building certain muscles will change the appearance of your body as well, so I guess to answer that question, it would depend on what specifically you want to change about your body.

unitedkingdom,8,0,8,"&gt;Its a stupid rule anyway since you can just gift your money away a few years before you die.

 The reason UKIP want to remove inheritance tax is because it stops the rich getting richer. And because (some) people are avoiding a law, the law should be removed?

&gt;Introduce an Australian-style points-based immigration system to assess all potential migrants to Britain on a fair, ethical and equal basis

Australia has a terrible immigration system, and I doubt UKIP would be able to use the same system to make it any better.

&gt;Ensure big corporations pay their fair share of tax

Vague and not unique to UKIP. also fair share of tax is most likely in regard to reducing the amount of tax paid.

&gt;I believe in the democratic choice of the people.

Up until very recently the majority of the British public thought the death penalty should be legal, direct democracy is not inherently a good system especially when so few people are educated on the topic and have been led by the media to believe EU = EVIL, despite the fact its been repeatedly shown that both the EU and Immigration have been good for the UK

&gt;This would stop people from using our NHS at a cost to us and is hardly an unreasonable prospect.

Do you realise what an incredibly ridiculous and unreasonable policy is? The only way someone could think this was a remotely good idea if they'd been completely misled on the reality of ""NHS Tourism"".

space,3,0,3,"True, 'fast' interstellar travel just doesn't seem likely. But I vehemently disagree that humanity will go extinct on this planet.

If we manage to figure out asteroid colonies, humanity could slowly span the distance by hopping between Oort cloud objects. The Oort cloud extends almost halfway to the nearest stars, and there are likely rogue bodies we could exploit in the interstellar gulf. It would take thousands of years, but a slow expansion would eventually reach the nearest stars.

And the technology needed for this method is just an engineering problem. We need to figure out asteroid mining, space based production and fusion technology to make it work. And you don't need a large initial population of humans in space to do it.",t3_353too,cr1a7eb,t1_cr124tg,t1_cr1a7eb

britishproblems,2,0,2,"My mum is not too old, but is very ill and is getting worse (degenerative lung problems). BT would randomly charge her 3 months in advance for no reason. She would spend a few hours on the phone and finally get it sorted, an ""apology"" and told it is sorted. Then after 3 months of paying normally it would happen again; they would claim no knowledge of the previous refund and conversations and it would be a few more hours of claims she is lying before finally the same result.

This happened for around three and a half years before we got the ombudsman involved, who eventually had to threaten BT to stop. They stopped - for 6 months this time, and then did it again claiming no knowledge of the ombudsman or previous problems.
They never explained why they randomly wanted her to pay quarterly, every time they claimed it was the normal way to pay when everyone knows that isn't true. Should also say she never missed a payment, even the 3 months would be taken ""correctly"" until she got the refund.

I have to say though I once had them and it was perfect, the only service problem I had was solved rapidly (although I used the lesser known online forum people to get it sorted), and apart from that time the service was perfect - they were just too pricey so I left.",t3_34xmli,cr1aqkl,t1_cqz7zth,t1_cr1aqkl

news,1,0,1,"The biggest problem, as I see it , is the way police enforce the law in many places in America.  Police are NOT THE LAW, they are hired by the government to enforce the law, to serve and protect the public. They are granted the right to use deadly force when it is necessary.  That needs to be strongly clarified and appropriate laws enacted. 

They are not judge and jury in a position to feel that a criminal or suspected criminal needs to be killed. Beating or mauling a suspect to death is criminal. Shooting an unarmed man thirty feet away in the back is murder. Police should use the correct means to apprehend a suspect. Not beat him or kill him because he pissed them off. A police officer can always stop your vehicle for suspicious driving. They can always find a way to ""fear you were grabbing for their weapon."" 

I served in the USMC. I also worked for a period of time as a Correctional Officer in a prison.  I was not a cop. I served tower duty, armed. Every single inmate was informed when incarcerated, that attempted escape may result in their being shot and killed. Our orders were to use a rifle, a shotgun or a pistol in the tower, whatever means necessary ""To Stop With Certainty"". Not shoot to kill. I never had to do it, thankfully. An inmate once asked me if I would. I nodded, looked him directly in the eye and asked him to please never put me in the position where I had to make that decision.

Going to a therapist was invaluable for me, but at that age overcoming something like social anxiety is trying and any good therapist will challenge their patient in many ways.

Additionally, black kids have a much higher chance of living in poverty where their food quality and nutrition are effected.

And there are really fair reasons why that's the case. You guys got some 2 million a year in the AAC. That's less than half of what Michigan pays its football coach. You'll be fine on the long run (when you start getting full B1G payouts) which is what the B1G gambled on when they took you in.

Yes, you did beat us at football (fair and square) at which you are decent (just like us). We pulled a real Clemson because of our dork of a coach.

Our women's bball team went to back-to-back FF and didn't lose a game in B1G play this year. Our women's lax lost a single game in the last two years.

In Zeal, just after rescuing Melchior from Mount Woe, Schala shows up. *She tells Melchior and your party that the Mammon Machine will not work without her,* and she has turned her back on the machine.

Dalton shows up and grabs Schala and attacks Janus when he tries to aid her. The party draws their weapons, to which Dalton says, ""Stay back. The life of this woman means nothing to me!"" and the party stands down.

Maybe I'm just crazy, but how does this ridiculous bluff fool Crono and the gang? If anything happened to Schala, Queen Zeal would have flayed him alive! They should have called the bluff and attacked Dalton!",t3_3586tm,cr273ra,t3_3586tm,t1_cr273ra

diablo3,1,0,1,"There's a lot to recommend making a seasonal character namely that there are a greater number of people playing seasonal characters, so that once you hit 70 with yours asnd you want to group up to do endgame content such as Rifts/Greater Rifts you can more easily find groups as well the number of populated communities which offer Lootshare/T6 carries.  You can still level a Seasonal Character in Story Mode and you don't need to accept help/boosting.  But once you want to branch out it will avoid the need of levelling a seasonal character.  Once the season is complete seasonal characters and all your gear transfer over to your nonseasonal account so you don't lose them.

That being said I completely agree with the others that have suggested leveling on your own so you can experience the enjoyment of the progressing through the story and learning your class yourself.  There's more than enough time after hitting 70 to transition to grinding for better gear and pushing for progression in Greater Rifts to try and get on the leaderboards.

I guess my comment did come across as rude, but I made it out of frustration of all these more superficial things being considered as 'essential'. I mean, what would that make me then? Not a woman? It was sorta selfish, but I see OP's intention now (though I still don't really agree with most commenters). 

It's also a bit ironic that we have so many threads reassuring each other that confidence doesn't lie in appearance, and here we are considering all these outwardly things as essential. I can't really mesh these two things in my mind.

Anyway, sorry I can't offer more than this. I realize a lot of the world doesn't see it this way (I guess that's the whole problem), but I accept transwomen as women way before they even start presenting as one.

Also, people keep coming back to the C+ statement as an excuse to flame him. So what if it was a bit out there? He's just making a prediction. Picking up Karma isn't going to guarantee that OpTic are going to win every LAN event, he has the right to an opinion. Karma is a fantastic player but if you remember correctly, he's been on two so-called ""godsquads"" before than have ended up failing. nV in BO2 went from being a t2 team to placing outside the t8 when they dropped Stainville for Karma. ON with Teep, Proof, Boze/Swanny and Karma also looked amazing on paper and also failed to place well. 

Now, I personally believe OpTic are going to be just as dominant with Karma, but using recent history as a reference, saying that OpTic picking up Karma wasn't an amazing move isn't as stupid as people are making it out to be.

&gt; Walk around in many retail stores and the men’s turtleneck is nowhere to be found, while there are stacks for women. We’re not quite sure why this is since the turtleneck is such a versatile piece.

I haven't met many men, even those who do like dressing up, who like turtlenecks.  I think there are a good few reasons.  Most men seem to think they are more feminine.  Personally, I really don't like the feeling of it on my neck.  I like scarves more, and, if it is more casual indoors, I might try to pull off a keffiyeh around my neck.

On Shawl collars

I fully agree.  I think these are the sweaters that allow for the most room creatively.  They show the underlying layers very easily.  You can play around with the roll.  You can choose how to button them generally.  Definitely my favorite type.

Cool site.  Their basic guides seem pretty solid, but I'm not a huge fan of how they do the pants so much.  Breaks are important, but I think I just don't like how they got it in the photos.

programming,1,0,1,"I think Raganwald got the wrong end of the stick in the above piece, but since you showed up right here I can ask you /u/svpino

I really thought the point of your article was to illustrate a good way to separate the people who had clearly coded before from the people who were essentially trying to bluff their way into a programmer job.

And I also got the impression that these would be ""in person"" questions, where the interviewer and interviewee are in the room for one hour *together* as the interviewee works on the problems.

I imagined myself gliding pretty easily through the first three, offering up a solution that got the main thrust of number four (explaining how I realized my answer might not have caught every possible case but moving on  to number five anyway in case of short time)...

Then doing something brutishly forceful with number five (to continue to demonstrate something concrete) then maybe introduce the idea of optimizing my answer to number five, or positing that there could be a more elegant way to handle it, and re-iterating that my answer to number 4 could also use some refining...

That's when the interviewer gives me a better idea of what is a priority. 

But my point is that *at this point*, even with no time left, I've demonstrated that I can think algorithmically (even recursively) and I am aware that what I've produced can be improved upon, and hopefully at least verbally showed some ideas for directions for refining the last two solutions. And, with more time, you go all out, offer multiple solutions for the different possible goals.

Wouldn't you call this a ""pass""?? Like I said, you introduced the post by setting the bar pretty low (you need to weed out the people who don't actually program and just know buzzwords).

So Raganwald's fretting over trying to guess exactly what the interviewer wanted in the first place seems like a completely moot point. No one is suggesting the interview should be like a solitary-confinement test, ""hand in your answers and we'll call you next week...""",t3_35afm0,cr30low,t1_cr2r9ky,t1_cr30low

medicine,3,0,3,"I'm a third year medical students myself but ya, there are a few problems I can think of.

First, prophylactic surgery is pretty rare in the first place and really only done if there is a significant reduction in mortality (e.g. Mastectomy). Prophylactic surgery on a non-essential part of the body for monetary reasons seems unlikely. Moreover, complications happen and nobody wants to play with the possibility of ruining the career of an exceptionally healthy adult male. That would be ridiculous and embarrassing.

Second, outside of science fiction, I have never heard of a surgery bringing the function of person above that of a perfectly healthy adult. Surgery at its best is really just well-controlled damage which is done when it fulfills an adequate risk to benefit ratio.

Original Post:

**Are we obligated to pay a bill on someone else's insurance policy? (Complicated, custody, insurance)**

&gt; Ok this is tricky so here are people involved here 
&gt; 
&gt; KID A - youngest child of PARENTS M&amp;amp;D
&gt; KID B - oldest child of PARENTS M&amp;amp;D
&gt; PARENT M - mother
&gt; PARENT C - engaged to PARENT M (me)
&gt; PARENT D - father
&gt; PARENT L - married to PARENT D
&gt; 
&gt; Until the beginning of this year both KID A and B were on state insurance because PARENT M (mom) is a single mother.  All of their medical costs were covered on this insurance. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; For Reasons Unknown the kids were put on PARENT L's health insurance plan beginning 2015. PARENT L works while PARENT D stays home with their new baby.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; KID A hurts her knee. It gets infected during a weekend stay at PARENT D and L's house. PARENT L takes KID A to the ER. KID A takes medicine and gets better. 
&gt; 
&gt; PARENT M receives a bill for $xxxx.xx for the ER stay.  PARENT M learns that PARENT L has instructed the hospital to forward any balance to PARENT M, who doesn't pay a premium and has never agreed to pay any remaining balance, also never agreed or discussed other insurance options with PARENTs L and D. 
&gt; 
&gt; Is PARENT M obligated to pay a hospital bill  that was partially paid by PARENT L's health insurance coverage?  
&gt;

He isn't just sitting on a throne in heaven and his call to discipleship is just as relevant right now as it was 2,000 years ago.  We try to answer that call every day.  The first principles of the gospel our church teaches are faith in the lord, Jesus Christ, and repentance.  And so, our main focus is to develop our faith in Christ and to learn how to repent, so that we might be forgiven and enjoy the joy that man was meant to have.

Of course, as you learn, you'll have many questions.  Your primary resource is the one you've already discovered:  Prayer and an open heart so that you can receive God's answer.  Secondary to that, you have the missionaries, local members in your area (I highly recommend starting to go to church and feeling the spiritual environment there), and members online like here and on mormon.org.

Anyway, welcome to the sub, and whenever you have a question, just pop by and ask about it.  We do have a little bit of a mixed bag here that isn't necessarily representative of the church-attending active membership in the church, but you'll get answers from believing members (check users' post history when confused).",t3_35cjho,cr3efia,t3_35cjho,t1_cr3efia

It's pretty simple though and analogous to junk food. You start cutting it out of your life and you have to replace it with healthier food, because you have to eat something. That's well and good, but if you don't work on yourself mentally to begin liking healthy food or learning how to prepare it, your former master of junk food is more than ready to sweep in and take over again, worse than before. You see this in the people who diet off and on again- inevitably they gain whatever was lost and then some!

The only real difference is that it in all practicality, you can just stop PMO. You won't physically die if you don't replace it with something else. But because this is spiritual problem and you are spiritually dead in this sin, you have to replace it with Jesus, so that you may become alive again! 

It's a transformative mindset shift. The abstainers think, ""just stay away from porn, just stay away from porn"" and don't address anything else in their life, everything stays the same except there is no porn. Those in recovery learn that this is more than just staying away. It is running towards Jesus and embracing all the changes he has for your new life, not just 'no porn'.

TSM/C9 were rushing for first to avoid CLG, everyone lower was rushing to avoid being 6th... they were **scary** for everyone in the NALCS and didn't choke in playoffs until the team ignored a Nien call and did something else which cost them the game.

I have recently rediscovered mindfulness and stumbled upon an article that discusses [mindfulness and loneliness](http://www.everyday-mindfulness.org/mindfulness-and-loneliness/). I think that is a very good approach to the whole situation. The author puts it in a way that I could've not said better myself:

&gt; You cannot rely on other people for your happiness. It certainly does help to have positive people surrounding you, but you cannot assume they’ll be there every second of every day. You have to be your own motivator. You have to respect and encourage yourself first.

This includes waiting for a relationship to ""cure"" loneliness, or a new friend, or attending a party or getting a new job. Loneliness is a feeling and feelings are not curable. They just come and go and you act on them or then not. It is up to you, one is not preferable to the other.

But because it's probably an outlier. It goes way against the general trend. You can't just throw out 5 years worth of data as meaningless because one year seems off. You don't have to take it out, but you should recognize the trend. It also probably has something to do with him playing farther away from the basket as well though. It's really not all over the board beyond that one year though. Strictly up for DJ, strictly down for Blake.

AskReddit,2,0,2,"The stress. I was just talking to a fellow business owner, and he hadn't slept in days. I frequently have insomnia, heart palpitations, or just burst into tears, sometimes at some pretty inconvenient moments. 

Everything that will ever go wrong in this business is directly or indirectly my fault. If I don't foresee the challenges, everything could come crumbling down around me. Everything that goes right feels like a miracle, and it's almost never what I wanted to happen. 

Our two-year anniversary is next week and we've basically limped along from one quarter to the next, always just making it, never really doing better than that. That changed last quarter, and we did really well, but the quarter before was the worst quarter on record. I was going to close down. 

And everybody wants money from you. Taxes, social security, and health insurance take 50% or more of my net income. Everything else goes to bills. Salespeople are calling constantly, one bad contract could tank me forever. But one good contract only gets us through one quarter.  

And yet, I wouldn't do anything else. I think that's why this is so challenging. If everybody knew how amazing it feels to be making things happen at the head of your own venture, I think we'd have a nation of business owners and no employees ever again. Which, I'm actually not opposed to. 1/3 of the American workforce is already independent contractors anyway. But that's a whole different pitch.",t3_35f81b,cr3ulu2,t3_35f81b,t1_cr3ulu2

You will make them sometimes it's the choice you make after that decides where your life is going.

It's a little bit heavier, but it helps with dry, flakey  skin, and with evening skin tone. It CAN help with acne depending on what your acne is caused by. 

Ro's Argan is like a conditioner for your body the way you condition your hair. Wash up, then slather on, then rinse, and it removes your need to use lotion. There's also Turkish Delight, which has 1000 rose petals in every tub, and it's similar to the Ro's Argan in the moisturizer, no need for lotion effect, but it also has a suds to it so it's a soap too.

&gt;You didn't answer my question; you didn't give solid reasons until I called you out on it.

I am sorry, I didn't realize you were so daft that you literally couldn't understand why they included bloatware. I thought you were asking ""Why should they?"" (i.e. Why should they have the right to?) Your ambiguously stated query left it open for interpretation.
&gt;You're ignoring large parts of my argument and giving disjointed ones back.

I'm sorry, I didn't realize that I was obligated to acknowledge and individually respond to every word you write. I'd like to take this time to throw in your face everything I've said that's gone unaddressed, but this is getting too long already. Since you made it a point of picking out one question that I had not answered previously and suggested that I was evading, I chose that particular part to reply to, and it was quite verbose.
&gt;You take a look at your notification panel yet? I don't see the reason I should lose functionality of being able to read notifications for 2 options that I'll never use, but I guess you're ignoring that side of the argument.

That's because I'm having an argument about bloatware, not slight settings differences between various models. I was really just curious what you were talking about is the only reason I even asked.

MonsterHunter,1,0,1,"The slowing down is for all weapons and all monsters. It's one of the factors in finding out where a weak spot is. 

For hitting a hard to reach weak spot, there's a sort of opportunity cost. The LS can immediately reach it and go for a break, but the IG requires mounting which can take time and a couple of strikes before it falls. Mounting damage + uninterrupted combos may or may not end up doing more damage than straight up LS slashing. Depends on skill, depends on monster. 

For rajang, IG loses one of its core components, which is at will mounting so you end up losing effectiveness. And its a lot harder to mount smaller creatures, but mounting isn't a necessity. But I can agree with you that larger monsters=easier mounts=easier for the IG. 

Does the IG have that many openings? I most often get hit by monsters walking which do chip damage. If there's no large opening, I just use X-&gt; back A to A-&gt;A which is quick and lets you get out. If you're being greedy, the X-X-X combo and X-X-A-X combo has a massive downtime at the end which I suppose can kill you easily.",t3_35glec,cr4ayuv,t1_cr4asuu,t1_cr4ayuv

fivenightsatfreddys,1,0,1,"I keep seeing people think that the Phone Guy and Purple Guy are the same people, and I have a theory that could clear Phone Guy's name. The main reason I found a problem with was phone guy's death. Phone Guy and Purple Guy's deaths have several notable differences. First of all, Phone Guy dies on night four with the animatronics knocking on the door before Freddy gets him, so we can more or less deduce that he died in the guard station you play in FNAF 1. Purple guy on the other hand, dies in the safe room by being scared into the Bonnie suit and having the springs lock up on him. You could argue that Phone Guy was dragged to the safe room and then killed, but in FNAF 3 we hear him tell us that the safe room was being sealed up, and making sure that nobody would know about it. He also explicitly states that employees shouldn't mention the room to insurance representatives. Why make that distinct statement, if they are sealing the safe room due to budget cuts? Unless Purple Guy is already dead, and in order to avoid negative PR, the death of Purple Guy is hidden away. Also, in FNAF 2, he talks about how the old establishment was ""left to rot for a bit"". This means that FNAF 2 happens a substantial amount of time after the sealing of the Safe Room. Phone Guy has to be alive in order to record these tapes, and because of the sheer amount of time between them, He is not guilty for murdering all those kids.",t3_35boew,cr4esox,t3_35boew,t1_cr4esox

But in summary, Robb's competency barely went beyond leading his cavalry on the battlefield, and being aggressive operationally. He had the bare minimum of an operational or strategic plan, which didnt even coordinate or incorporate his detached forces and let them to their own devices. Was terrible about disseminating information to his leaders. And had a poor conceptualization of his role as leader on the battlefield, leading to such moves as the King himself storming a small backwater castle when his status was nto at risk, when he could easily have invested it pillaged the area, or let other storm it.

wow,2,0,2,"&gt;Apparently people are also starting to solo bosses from Mogu'Shan Vaults (MoP), but these people are usually pretty well-geared and skilled.

At least as a hunter MSV is not that difficult (up to Elegon, haven't bothered to go beyond that). Frankly, mine is neither well-geared nor am I particularly skilled (not terrible, but not great either), but only the spiritbinder was annoying, after I learned how to properly deal with the Quilens. Apart from him, to me 25H spine is more difficult. Nalak is also totally doable with a pet, although he has an absolutely frustrating habit of randomly despawning mid-combat for no apparent reason. I think some (better-geared) people are also soloing ToT, although I haven't tried that myself yet. 

Edit: Also, Sha of Anger and Galleon seem soloable, but the few times I've personally done them, others have always showed up. World bosses are obviously not really interesting for the money, but for the mounts, but I figured they're still worth mentioning in a soloing thread.

Something that no one seems to have mentioned is that there is a dragon boss that you're supposed to heal in ICC. *You don't actually have to do the boss*, you can just walk past him. Took me a while to realise.",t3_35i39s,cr4rsxy,t1_cr4levi,t1_cr4rsxy

DistantWorlds,1,0,1,"Hi! I'm glad you are getting into and enjoy the game; its my favorite. What Size and kind of map do you play on? (Spiral, other?)

1) For colonization you want to research Colonization in the HighTech &amp; Industrial Tree (Note: it takes a LONG time to research this one). Then you want to check the Energy &amp; Construction Tree and see that you have the Space Construction tech researched.

2)You can set ships to patrol the mining stations. One way is to select the ship, then hover cursor over target base until cursor becomes a circle, then right click, That ship will now patrol that base. Or, select a fleet, and do the same thing. Also, keep in mind that you can customize how much a pain in the arse the Pirates are in the game set-up screens. Custom designing you own ships is ALWAYS a good idea.

3) This one depends largely on each map situation, and your play style. Taking out Pirate bases when you know where they are (and are strong enough) is, again, a good way to go. In the very early game, it might be a good idea to pay them for protection until you are stronger. ",t3_35iodg,cr4teo9,t3_35iodg,t1_cr4teo9

* Know your family history. If no one in your family on either side ever had ""X"" the chance that you will have ""X"" is pretty small. And if you know that, say. heart problems run in your family, you cal alert your GP to that so you both can keep an eye on heart health.    
* Regular medical checkup: At least once a year, go see your GP. I'd also recommend at least once a year for seeing the eye doctor.    
* Do self-checks for cancer: [Testicles](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/testicularcancer/moreinformation/doihavetesticularcancer/do-i-have-testicular-cancer-self-exam) and [Skin](http://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/early-detection/step-by-step-self-examination).    
* If you have any unusual symptoms, go to the doctor right away. Sudden weight loss or gain. lethargy when that's abnormal, issues sleeping, digestive issues, serious pain anywhere.    
* I'd say have a A1C, and a blood and urine panel at your yearly exam. Get a flu shot each flu season, and ask for a Pneumonia vaccine once every 5 years.

&gt;__Pedophilia__ or __paedophilia__ is a [psychiatric disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_disorder) in which an adult or older adolescent experiences a primary or exclusive [sexual attraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_attraction) to prepubescent children, generally age 11 years or younger.   As a medical [diagnosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnosis), specific criteria for the disorder extend the cut-off point for prepubescence to age 13.  A person who is diagnosed with pedophilia must be at least 16 years of age, but adolescents must be at least five years older than the prepubescent child for the attraction to be diagnosed as pedophilia.

trees,1,0,1,"How I define being high has changed since I began to smoke 3 years ago in terms of the contrast between being sober and being high, or what is normal and what is unfamiliar. I enjoy the effects of being high, but part of the magic of the herb was my reaction to the unfamiliarity of being high. The longer I smoked, the more used I was to being high, and the more I smoked the longer I would be in the ""haze"". As the effects of weed became more familiar, and the more accustomed to weed my body became, I began to increase the quantity and frequency of my smoking, which caused an increase in my tolerance and a deemphasis of the magic of weed's unfamiliarity. Based on my experience, I conjecture that what you are experiencing is an acclimation to your high state, and what upping your volume/ consistency will produce is a higher tolerance of weed. I do not believe that you will achieve the magic of unfamiliarity. We all start out chasing the magic dragon, but in reality we move farther and farther away from it with every puff we take. What you need is a multi-month tolerance break if you hope to achieve a new-stoner level of high. Or some groady toadstools.",t3_35ki46,cr59te3,t3_35ki46,t1_cr59te3

changemyview,4,0,4,"I know you're sad about this, but this isn't going to be a post that addresses that.

You're really, really condescending to women if you think you're going to be lonely forever simply because of a couple of minor physical differences over which you are insecure.  So many people out there of both genders are so much smarter and deeper than that, and you're assuming that everyone will be shallow.  I don't know why you have that expectation; it can come from any number of places.  But you should probably rid yourself of that.  Understand that if you meet someone, and you two don't hit it off, it's not likely that it's because you're bald or not over six feet tall.  It's because you're both *incredibly deep and nuanced humans*, and that on some of the incalculably large number of variables involves, you two don't sync up.  Complicated people need likewise complicated people, and the more complicated you are the more difficult it is to find a match.

I'm 6'2, have hair down to my waist, and am artsy and poetic as hell.  I'm also single, while my bald, 5'7 friend is married and expecting his first.  You know what you and I have in common that we don't share with my friend?  We worry like crazy over the affections of a woman we haven't even met yet.  We wax poetic about our feelings to strangers on the internet at night.  We spend out time trying to figure out how to make our beloved world better because we care, instead of watching boob tube all night.  We're *complicated*.  So while I'll be jealous of my friend for having been married and being loved that way, I know that it isn't because of anything physical, but because his heart had a lock, and mine a thumbprint scanner.",t3_35jkn0,cr5d1kb,t3_35jkn0,t1_cr5d1kb

 “Hello” I shouted “What do you want?”

 “Cats what the-” I was rudely cut off by the glass shattering screech of one of them which was followed by a more ferocious growl. Continuing to slowly creep backwards I couldn’t help but think of this being a perfect scene for a horror movie I mean we have the humble victim, the eerie strange ‘bad guy’ and of course the dark creepy alley way that is lit enough for you to see what’s going on but still leaves a lot to the imagination. 
 “Snap out of it” I exclaim while shaking my head. I was scaring myself more than these creepy eight or so cats were scaring me. The cats let out another out of tune symphony of screeches and began to quickly approach, I turned and ran towards my apartment building. I was chased by a sea of hisses and growls as well as cats scratching at my feet and jumping up taking swipes at my backpack.
 “Get off me, go away” I repeated while shooing them with my feet. Outside my apartment door I shuffled through my bag, the cats seemed to get more agitated, looking for my keys. They continued to claw at me and my backpack then manage to forage half a tuna sandwich I had left from lunch.
 “You’re hungry? I have nothing for you.” I announced in a panic whilst standing up. They didn't seem pleased and let out more senile hisses. I couldn't find my keys in my backpack. So I rummaged through my pockets accidentally pulling my headphones out of my phone. DMX’s ‘X gon give it ya’ played on full volume and the masculine barking sounds scared the cats away. I find my key in my back pocket and quickly unlock the door and drag my backpack in. I close the door and lock it immediately. Leaning against the door I ask myself “Why do I live in this place.”

pcmasterrace,1,0,1,"&gt; See, that's the problem. If you play on a Playstation, you play by Sony's rules. Period. This is not the case for PC, and Steam's current monopoly on too many titles is gravely unfortuante but nowhere near the control of Sony/MS/Nintendo and their respective consoles.

Oh, please give me a bucket. Consoles are not open source like PCs, never were. Frankly I'm not bothered by that.

&gt; Yes, as I touched upon earlier, PC certainly has exclusives, but they have them for understandable reasons- either the developers budget is too small to get on console (the initial fee for getting on a console is astronomical, and headway for indie titles on consoles is nowhere near as prominent as it is on PC), OR the game simply CANNOT work on consoles.

I don't understand your point here. PC exclusives like Star Citizen have massive budgets - although frankly the quality of the game matters more than the budget.

You forget that gaming on a PC is just plain different - people invest in mods etc. too, even if said game was originally a console port.

&gt; These two factors, obviously, are not present for console exclusives. Consoles titles are easier to port, are cheap to port, and there is no title that would work on a console but not a PC. Console exclusives exist because Sony/MS/Nintendo pay for those exclusives to exist, nothing more.

Honestly don't care if there are console exclusives. Exclusives has been a thing for all platforms for decades now. Your naive open-source world would suck all competition away, IMO.

&gt; You might not be fussed but by purchasing non-modular technology you're providing economic incentive to continue that way. Is a future where most if not all technology is non-modular a future you want?

Slippery slope argument. There is plenty of modular tech to go about - my modular synth being an example outside my gaming PC. PC builds are still quite popular and honestly don't see them dying anytime soon.

&gt; If you don't like what Sony does, tough titties turkleton. Your gaming experienced, in its totality, is OWNED by them, not you.

You know what happens if you double cross steam, right? All your games go. Same issue.

&gt; But on PC, we can use our wallets to support or defy bad practices since there's multiple companies and projects butting heads in nearly every aspect of the PC. Steam w/ Linux and Vulkan vs Microsoft w/ Windows and DX12, Origin vs Steam, AMD vs Nvidia, Intel vs AMD, Corsiar vs Coolermaster; we have options, and while some are certainly under threat and we suffer the consequences of that situation, we have never been in a situation where we are forced to comply with a company's decisions to stay on PC.

There's no ""we"", here. Only you. Options are great when it comes to PCs, but sometimes it's not the end all and be all. When you buy a console, you buy an appliance specifically made for gaming. Buying a PC is like buying lego in comparison.",t3_35jdx1,cr5lcm6,t1_cr5koni,t1_cr5lcm6
starbucks,2,0,2,"I'm Dutch/American and work in the Netherlands. There are both corporate and licensed stores here but the licensed stores outnumber corporate massively. However, the licensed stores look and operate almost exactly like a corporate store, so there won't be that much of a difference there.

The language barrier shouldn't really be a problem – I've even met SM's that are not Dutch. There are plenty of partners at my store who don't speak Dutch at all, or at a minimal level. You'll have plenty of time to learn and most of the terms are in English anyway. Whenever there's something that you don't understand, you can always snag a Dutch partner to help you out!

Blink main meepo on to the target you want to kill, sheep them if you have that item, poof the rest of your meepos in. Right click the main target until dead, while tabbing through your meepos to keep them netted.

If one meepo gets low, micro him away from the rest; have the rest continue to net/right click whoever is coming after your low meepo. 

The hardest part is avoiding the aoe lockdown if the enemy team has it. Don't blink-poof until lina has casted her LSA for example, or  only blink-poof if you think you can instantly blow someone up.

Teamfight meepo is rarely about microing your dudes to doing a bunch of different stuff; it's mostly about microing your meepo to keep whichever one is low alive while the rest a-click or net someone. ",t3_35mb9h,cr5pp18,t3_35mb9h,t1_cr5pp18

Yikes! This isn't exactly feasible...

It would take *a lot* of either thrust or power to reshape Dragon's orbit throughout the solar system... Dawn only weighs 1200kg and needed a 10kW solar array to produce the meager thrust it harnessed. Dragon is 8-9 metric tonnes... so you're either going to have to put up with *very, very slow* thrust and upgrade the solar arrays (Dragon is 6kW, IIRC, probably less for Dragon 2), or you upgrade the solar array (and add mass) to some enormous size and only put up with just *mildly slow thrust*. RTG's don't provide enough power to do the job.

MensRights,2,0,2,"&gt;it's talking about men and boys and their problems

Which will all stem from feminism, Marxism, and lefty Democrats I guarantee you. They will not speak about gynocentrism.

&gt;Or are you predisposed to believe conservatives would never support men at all?

Not at all, I consider myself very far to the right. But IMHO PJ Media is not ""those types"" of conservatives.

&gt;and I don't believe they are hardcore gynocentrists that want to enslave men.

I don't believe that that's their actual intentions. As the saying goes though the road to hell is paved with good intentions.

&gt;It's the left that tries to legislate 

I'm not talking about legislation. Don't get me wrong I'm sure this is going to be a good piece that will talk about the family court system being screwed up and how colleges are being made into places where men often can't succeed and maybe even prison disparities and rape. But it's unlikely to talk about the pitfalls of marriage or how the expectations put on the male sex to provide and protect are extreme and unfair in a modern western society. They wont talk about the underlying problems and that's where I take issue.

First of all, I never said No at first, We were talking about how i didn't want him to watch a trailer (Digimon Adventure Tri, to be exact) 

The conversation went like this:

[06/05/2015 06:48:49 p.m.] Sky: oh, and there is a new trailer for Digimon Tri

[06/05/2015 06:49:05 p.m.] Sky: You would probably die so don't watch it

[06/05/2015 07:28:06 p.m.] Rubert Jenkins HR4: Is it like Monster Huunter

[06/05/2015 07:28:19 p.m.] Sky: no

[06/05/2015 07:28:24 p.m.] Sky: but it has cute boys

[06/05/2015 07:28:52 p.m.] Rubert Jenkins HR4: I'm going to watch it now

[06/05/2015 07:29:00 p.m.] Sky: No rubert

[06/05/2015 07:29:03 p.m.] Sky: please don't

[06/05/2015 07:29:05 p.m.] Sky: you will die

[06/05/2015 07:29:24 p.m.] Rubert Jenkins HR4: I can handle it

[06/05/2015 07:30:27 p.m.] Sky: no

[06/05/2015 07:30:34 p.m.] Sky: this is too much

[06/05/2015 07:31:21 p.m.] Rubert Jenkins HR4: None of them are 
on par with anyone from Free

[06/05/2015 07:31:31 p.m.] Sky: R.I.P Rubert

[06/05/2015 07:31:31 p.m.] Rubert Jenkins HR4: Get this weak shit out of here

[06/05/2015 07:31:35 p.m.] Sky: he will be missed

[06/05/2015 07:31:50 p.m.] Rubert Jenkins HR4: they aren't even that cute

[06/05/2015 07:32:09 p.m.] Sky: his last words were ""i can handle it""

[06/05/2015 07:33:16 p.m.] Rubert Jenkins HR4: Consider me underwhelmed

[06/05/2015 07:33:26 p.m.] Sky: he didn't handle it

[06/05/2015 07:34:32 p.m.] Sky: press F to pay respects to rubert

[06/05/2015 07:35:26 p.m.] Sky: F

[06/05/2015 07:40:58 p.m.] Rubert Jenkins HR4: Let's hope he does

[06/05/2015 07:42:03 p.m.] Sky: he was a great friend

[06/05/2015 07:42:46 p.m.] Rubert Jenkins HR4: Toad's so hot

[06/05/2015 07:43:38 p.m.] Sky: he always cared for other people except Kibbles' evil clone Cables

[06/05/2015 07:43:59 p.m.] Rubert Jenkins HR4: I would so kiss him and stroke his chest hair

[06/05/2015 07:44:19 p.m.] Sky: And he was also Bi, and never tried to hide it

[06/05/2015 07:44:54 p.m.] Rubert Jenkins HR4: And I would let him thrust his big, throbbing penis into my tight, virgin butthole

[06/05/2015 07:45:30 p.m.] Sky: http://blogs.discovery.com/.a/6a00d8341bf67c53ef0168e5dfbd0a970c-pi (The image is just of a Koala with his mouth open)

Then today i made a Chillin joke, and told him some stuff about Kirbycides, and then he linked me to a video, which is this: https://youtu.be/q0SyUgw98tE (I still haven't watched it)

Then, the following conversation happened:

Is this one of your weird boy videos

[05:36:04 p.m.] Rubert Jenkins HR4: What!?

[05:36:13 p.m.] Sky: you know

[05:36:21 p.m.] Sky: when you linked me to a boy anime

[05:36:22 p.m.] Sky: literally

[05:36:35 p.m.] Sky: and then i realized you were gay

[05:36:39 p.m.] Sky: but you said you were bi

[05:37:07 p.m.] Sky: but then ""And I would let him thrust his big, throbbing penis into my tight, virgin butthole"" happened

pcars,1,0,1,"&gt; I do agree that the car classes are quite confusing as there isnt anywhere in the game that lists out the cars in each classes.

When you go to the garage to edit a car, you have to select it from its class, not from an alphabetical list.  Here you can see the 8 ""classes.""  Touring cars, GT, Prototypes, Open wheel, Kart, etc.  

These 8 classes are so incredibly wrong that its a bit of a pain finding equal competition.

As you mentioned above in your other comment the FA has no business competing against the FB or any other open wheel.  The server settings allow for ""identical car"" or ""from the same class"" or ""any car.""  So, technically according to the game the FA, FB, FC, Frookie, and gulf 1000 are all the same class.  Obviously they arent, but this is how it is for now.  Hopefully an uproar is made over that as it actually does have an impact on the stats that are tallied.",t3_35mzko,cr68dwg,t1_cr670gg,t1_cr68dwg

No. A better analogy: a child asks ""Why is murder bad?"" and you respond by sending him to his room and grounding him. That is what people here did to me.

Whether it's fair that one race can lift buildings is a different question entirely. It's an asymmetric game. Sure, it's a strong advantage for Terran in a baserace, but they also have weaknesses in this situation - it's much easier for Zerg and Protoss to usefully continue unit production during basetrades.

Have written about this commonality of human and animal perceptions via the recognition activities we see from anemones, to ants, birds and the higher animals including the primates. You might find it interesting. It shows how much we DO have in common with the animals, tho ours are much higher developed. But which from a cosmic standpoint, of how big our universe is, and compared how small our brains are isn't that much, very likely!!

DebateReligion,1,0,1,"Im not sure what all the times means but yes I remember talking to you about the definition of 'Christian'. But here's the problem, I can only speak from my intellectual honesty of what I know about Christianity, but never on the behave of someone else's faith and beliefs. What Im saying is Ive never seen two Christians from the same denomination debating each other regarding this subject, and the absence of this definition is not helping anyone at all, especially for those who call themselves Christians. I am merely just trying to help progress the case, but I personally dont hold an opinion regarding this issue. The best I can do is to report all the different accounts Ive been told. So in it all, our discussion doesnt count because unless Ive confirmation-biased-ly ignored your answer, I dont think you've satistified the concern at all. I could definitely be wrong on this, but if you think you have the perfect answer then Im sure I can speak on the behave of this whole subreddit that we're anticipating to hear it - 'it' as in the universal definition to 'Christian' that could not be otherwise. Moreover this is only concern number 1, because if the definition ends up being something as pathetic as what my pastor told me (that a Christian just simply means someone's beliefs and faith that has something to do with Jesus being a central or important figure) then it doesnt remotely say or mean or imply anything at all. This is the greater concern number 2. Anyway, our last discussion you've implied that you do have this 'secret' formula to determining what a Christian is. For knowledge and truth's sake Im all ears.

Forum platforms are still, by far, the most active form of internet interaction between rpg players. If that wasn't true you'd see more posts on reddit or G+ for DnD, Pathfinder, Savage Worlds vs enworld, rpg.net or company official forums and you just don't. People just prefer forums, especially official ones.

Track your calories with an app or something like myfitnesspal.

If you weigh yourself everyday make sure to view the trend. Your weight can fluctuate by up to 5 pounds a day.   Weigh yourself at the same time and under the same conditions each time. Typically after waking up and vacating your bladder.

india,42,0,42,"Plot: Bhai is languishing in prison when India goes to war with Pakistan. As Indian army faces hellfire from beef eating Paki soldiers, the country is on the brink of collapse. A desperate nation turns to its one and only avenger - Bhai.

The country's new PM (played by Jayalalitha) agrees to release Bhai so he can save the country from Pakistan. Ramalingan Raju of Satyam decides to use his saved crorers to equip Bhai with the latest in military technology, including a spruced up Land Cruiser. 

As a final request, Bhai asks that Sanjay Dutt be released to accompany Bhai on his holy mission. The two take blessings from Asaram Bapu before departing for the border. 

Like the Iron Man and War Machine, the two wreck havoc on Pakistani army, with Bhai single handedly killing 1,000 Pakistani soldiers with his left pectoral muscle.

Along the way, Bhai falls in love with Priyanka Chopra. Since he is on the border, Bhai has to resort to WhatsApp forwards to profess his love. 

After he comes back from avenging the country, Bhai proposes to Priyanka. However, since Priyanka Chopra's father is no more, he has to take blessings from the road named in his honor to get approval for the marriage. The road agrees, rumbling loudly (which, it turns out, was just an aftershock from the Nepal quake).

All ends well as the PM decides to grant Bhai amnesty.

    3 pounds of honey
    1 whole clove

The only yeast I could find was an Ale yeast, I hydrated it in a bowl and put it in my demijohn, they threw in my honey dissolved in water and topped up the bottle. Then put in the oranges, raisins and clove, gave it a shake and put the airlock on.

I'm worried because a lot of the yeast seems to have settled at the bottom straight away, is that normal? It's bubbling away slowly now about a day later, maybe I was just expecting it to get going a bit quicker. ",t3_35tl2u,cr7xiw5,t3_35tl2u,t1_cr7xiw5

1/2 teaspoon of cardamon

A pitch of saffron if you have it

A teaspoon of rosewater if you have it

Open cardamon pods and crush the seeds in mortar/pestle or similar.  Add together and blend.  Serve cold.  If it's bitter, you either didn't add enough sugar or added too much cardamon. 

- **Jamaican Banana Punch**

2 ripe bananas

1 cup vanilla ice cream

1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

2 tablespoon honey

3 cups cold milk

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg

They printed magazines like [Creepy](http://a142.idata.over-blog.com/2/45/65/19/album-5/album-6/CreepyMagazine-042-00.jpg), [Eerie](http://popculture.mearsonlineauctions.com/ItemImages/000046/46342b_lg.jpeg), and [1984](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/97/1984c2.jpg). 

I bought an issue without even knowing it was for mature readers ***and there were boobies in there!***  My first reaction was ""This fucking rocks!""  And they're slaying dragons too!  Titties and dragonslaying, it was like an act of genius to an eleven year old.   

There was also [Heavy Metal](http://payload153.cargocollective.com/1/1/60195/5362428/Heavy-Metal-Magazine-Covers-from-The-1980s-21.jpg) and [Epic](https://d1466nnw0ex81e.cloudfront.net/n_iv/600/1077449.jpg). They did not have hardcore images, but they did have softcore and naked boobies.  *Lots* of boobies.  And I like boobies (I wanna squeeze them).   And when you were under 18 in the early eighties you took what you could get your hands on.  

Since these were sold as magazines they were actually on sale in supermarket magazine racks.  I never once bought these magazines in a comic book store because they were too smart, they knew these magazines were for people 18 and over.  So I always bought them from the supermarket because they didn't have a clue what the hell those magazine were.  And you didn't have to be clever about it like purchase a dozen items and try to bury it in there hoping they won't notice it.  That's a waste of money.  I stacked them right on top of each other.  Heavy Metal, Epic, 1984, Creepy, Eerie.  ""For Readers 18 and above"" in plain sight for every one of them and not once did they ever pay attention to it.  ",t3_35v0xg,cr82qaj,t3_35v0xg,t1_cr82qaj

5. They could be the employees that died in springlock suits or something.
6. They presumably haunted the toy animatronics.
7. He has no endoskeleton, so it's probably his only way of getting around. He is haunted, after all.
8. Probably because the endoskeleton thing could just be bullshit made up by Fazbear Entertainment to explain why the animatronics are so murderous.
10. The puppet can be seen very rarely throughout the building. He might have come to try and kill Springtrap, since he is the purple guy.
13. He might have just been blamed for the animatronics being haunted and murderous or for the presumed tampering with them that purple guy did. He's also there on night 7, the custom night, so maybe he figured out how to control them or something.

There are also some other questions we should ask ourselves:

1. Why aren't there phantom versions of all the toy animatronics, only for Mangle and BB?
2. When were the Mk. I animatronics introduced, were they the replacements for the springlock animatronics?
3. Why does purple guy change appearance drastically between different minigames?
4. Why is purple guy purple? Is it because of failed facial recognition or something?
5. Does FNAF 2 happen right before the investigation like we assumed, or is it afterwards?
6. When exactly is FNAF 1?
7. We know FNAF 3 is ""30 years later,"" but relative to what?
8. When was the first Freddy Fazbear's Pizza opened? Early eighties?
9. When was Fazbear's Family Diner open?
10. Did the diner have animatronics, or just suits?
11. What happened to the ghosts of the children and purple guy after FNAF 3?

Consistency is good. No argument.

I think my only remaining concern is a really small one. Assuming that I'm understanding the interface correctly, we're giving a griefer the power to block access to an important portal with their own portals. [Here is an example.](http://i.imgur.com/8f3C3eH.jpg)

Not a big concern today, but later down the road, it is going to be a problem.

This could be mitigated with some logic to make sure that a personal portal either doesn't block another portal [harder to code], or simply isn't too close to an existing portal [easier to code].",t3_35u5f8,cr8h598,t1_cr80sx1,t1_cr8h598

So I'm drinking on my porch (pretty fucking plastered) with some of my roommates and a couple girls. Random chick (solid 7) and her boyfriend (I'll get to him at the end) come to the porch and she asks to use our bathroom.  I was already on my way inside so I told her I would show her to the bathroom.  

I bring her up to our second floor bathroom and she grabs my hand and starts making out with me in the hall.  I bring her into the bathroom and one thing leads to another and next thing I know I'm railing this chick against the bathroom door.  About 30 seconds into banging her one of my roommates knocks on the door and we both stop.  We don't respond and my roommate goes back downstairs.  I then start making out with her again and grab her hand and take her across the hall back to my room.  We drunkenly banged on and off for a solid three hours.  

Me being the degenerate college senior that I was meant I had class the next morning at 8am.  I woke up and left her laying in my bed and when I got back she was gone.  Later that day my roommates said her boyfriend was waiting for her on the porch that night and was asking where his girlfriend was.  My roommates and her boyfriend were both really fucked up but when he found out she wasn't coming back out they said he just walked away screaming at the sky as loud as he could.

So about 2 minutes. ",t3_35thbb,cr8opy1,t3_35thbb,t1_cr8opy1

I'm absolutely not saying that this is what they're going to do, just pointing out that we can't really say what the repercussions will be yet.

Captain Cookie should be a pirate over a Murloc (at least until we can have multiple tribals on a card). Also it should summon a pirate whenever it takes damage. To avoid power creep maybe make it a 1/4?

Lady Deathwhisper could either use a stat boost or a mana cost reduction, you can compare her to Gazlow who is also a 3/6 that puts minions in your hand.

Kargath could honestly be fine if he was triggered by all units, not just friendlies. 

If Cyclone is going to cost 7, it should probably just effect your units. If you made it cost 4 or something like that I think it would be fine affecting all units.

fatpeoplehate,1,0,1,"Waaaaaaait a goddamn minute:

&gt;Votruba’s team defined two different body types as “thrifty” or “spendthrift” based on how the participants’ bodies burned calories during a 24-hour fast, measured in a whole-room calorimeter. (The room measures breath to calculate precisely how many calories the body is burning.) Some participants’ metabolism slowed down when they fasted, meaning they burned fewer calories – a thrifty person. “Therefore, when restricting calories, the body of a thrifty person slows its metabolism more in effort to conserve energy, making weight loss more difficult,” Votruba said.

&gt;In other words, the less the person eats, the fewer calories their body burns, relatively speaking. “Spendthrift” folks have the opposite going on: they burn calories faster when they fast.

Their metabolism slows down WHEN THEY FAST FOR 24 HOURS. How the fuck is that evidence that they can't lose weight on a calorie restricted diet?!

IT'S NOT THE BLOODY SAME!

Also, I don't see anywhere whether they accounted for body composition. If some of the participants were on high sodium diets before the study, they'll loose more weight after switching to low sodium due to water, for example.

Then again, I'm not sure they're even reporting accurately, when after all that they go on to say:

&gt;There is no easy way for the average person to learn whether they have a “thrifty” or “spendthrift” metabolism – only a few of those metabolic research chambers exist in the world – and it’s not clear that knowing would make a difference in terms of a weight loss strategy.

&gt;“In general, as things currently stand, weight loss strategies should be the same for all: make smart food choices, practice portion control and increase movement and exercise,” Votruba said. She pointed out that every volunteer in the study lost a significant amount of weight, suggesting that “regardless of biological differences, weight loss is plausible with sustained effort.”

I laughed so hard that all the brainstations in my brain got rewired again and ready to be happy, I stopped sogging about all those happy moments with my ex and stuff and just realised ""Life can be FKN FUN"". Hope you feel better bro",t3_360don,cr9jhsh,t1_cr9iuan,t1_cr9jhsh

atheism,6,0,6,"&gt; It's just the way he dug into this guy

Thanks for explaining. I suspect the irritable tone was in response to OP's numerous strawmen and rude generalizations.

&gt;The way i see it isn't atheism in itself just another dogma to be followed acting behind the guise of skepticism and science?

This is a classic talking point of religious apologists, and I just don't buy it. Dogmatism and a commitment to questioning dogma are exact opposites. There is an enormous difference between a religious fundamentalist, for example, who dogmatically believes the world is 6,000 years old, and a scientist who, based upon the best available evidence, thinks otherwise. (Which is not to say that believers aren't, in many scenarios, able to compartmentalize their religion and do fine work in the sciences.)

&gt;I really don't understand the point of standing up and preaching my opinions

If you think wrong beliefs have serious negative consequences on the world, then it makes sense to be outspoken. Also, here's the thing: Religious believers are actively spreading their wrongheaded beliefs. If everyone who disagrees remains quiet, then those beliefs monopolize the marketplace of ideas.

DebateAChristian,4,0,4,"&gt;So god should stop a lion from killing a weak fawn or baby elephant, too? 

Yes.  Evin if you can't understand a world in which death is unnecessary,  I can.  Yes I believe in ""natural evils,"" in this case, suffering.  But because I believe the world is not following the design of omnipotence, I can see the possibility for radical change.

&gt; Imagine an MMA fight, where punching or kicking became completely useless because god were preventing pain. How would you punish criminals and offenders if pain weren't an option?

Heaven forbid we not have enjoyable MMA fights.  What would the world come to without being able to watch people beat the shit out of each other.  Are you just trying to reinforce my point about the Christian attachment to brutality?  And I don't see how not being able to inflict pain on wrongdoers would be a problem, as, ex hypothesi, there are no wrongdoers.  

Your appeal to omniscience-based ethics is *EDIT* questionable.  It's either something you can't understand, in which case it could justify literally anything, and thus be useless as a system of ethics, or it's something you can understand, in which case it isn't incomprehensible *qua* omniscience.  This critique applies to all other forms of the ""God works in mysterious ways"" defense.

Listen: I've read Lewis and Tillich.  Lewis' counterargument to the argument from evil is a rehash of Augustine's and presumes to limit the power of an omnipotent God.  Here's the short form critique: if it is possible for humans to not sin (including Adam and Eve), and God is omniscient, then God could have created humans who would choose freely not to sin, in just the same way that he chose to create humans who would freely choose to sin.  Either you believe we are free, and thus God could have elected to create only those humans who would freely love him; or you believe we are not free.  If we are free, God chose to create the evil humans and is therefore evil; if we are not free, God created the evil directly and is therefore evil.

Tillich's conception of God as the ground of being builds the evil straight into God.  Rather than understanding God as making creative choices about how the universe should run, Tillich understands God to basically emanate existence, and create the possibility for freedom and thus for evil.  This is 1) a bastardization of Heidegger's already questionable ontology, 2) means that we can't posit good or evil of God, because he is causally related to evil outcomes to the same degree that he is causally related to good outcomes, which in turn means that 3) Tillich's God is tenuously related at best to the God of Christianity.

What you call a ""recycled appeal to ethics"" is actual humans caring about other humans.

What you call ""frustration"" is due to the fact that humans have the ability to imagine a better world and work towards it, but are aware of their limited power.  If you don't feel frustration at least sometimes in your life, you have never pushed the boundaries of your power to effect good in the world.  Of course if you believe that bliss follows death upon following pre-determined rules, you have little reason to push those boundaries or to experience the fullness of human life.",t3_3613da,cr9rnm6,t1_cr9r219,t1_cr9rnm6

SandersForPresident,64,0,64,"19 here, I've been kind of into politics for a while but quickly concluded the system is completely corrupt, save a few politicians. It's funny because I was kind of a socialist before I went to college and I knew about bernie sanders but I never really connected because he was in vermont and I was a high schooler who couldn't vote. 

I understand why many millennials don't vote, because we know the system is rigged and at one point in time, my friend circle described politics as ""Picking your poison"" Democrats or republicans the outcome is the same, it really does matter when a candidate for the presidency comes out and does what he say he does. 

edit - there seems to be a whole lot of people telling me to vote and providing reasons why I should and while I appreciate this but ultimately it's useless if you just tell one person on the internet. You really have to get my generation off it's feet and vote, like you gotta change things as a whole for young people to vote.

'Facilitates better' - RvP in his last season for us was a black hole for the other players, everything had to go through him and players like Ramsey struggled because of it.

'More mobile' - And? le pacey epik striker with 99 pace on fifa isn't infuckingdicitive of a good player. Giroud is not the fastest. He is however very fit and gets around the pitch to support our players. If we had a front three of manlet pace merchants we would be one-dimensional.

'Better finisher' - Yeah, he is up there in the goalscoring charts this season you are absolutely right on that point, well done you fucking knob.

'Played as a poacher' - Real life isn't FM, you don't play as a poacher, you do what the manager says and play to your strengths. Giroud holds the ball up and brings other players into play much, much, much better than van Persie ever did. We've had him for 3 years now and he's accomplished as much as van Persie did in 8 years. Like I said, if you want van Persie, maybe you supported the wrong team.

Yes, people say that if retailers had Little Mac, Captain Falcon, Rosalina, etc all readily in stock, then they would be making huge profits - but the arguing point is that these *relatively* obscure characters have a smaller fan base than Mario and company. So there would be a far greater likelihood of obscure characters remaining on shelves due to demand already having been met, and no sense of rarity to give an incentive for people to buy them - who are otherwise not interested in the characters. And this would come as a loss to retailers, whereas having Mario and company on the shelves, there is always going to be a kid who sees these figures and whose parents buy one for him, plus it's incentive to buy the main Mario games simultaneously in the store.",t3_362bp8,cra4lk7,t1_cra340b,t1_cra4lk7

AskReddit,2,0,2,"I feel like I've reached the point where I should tell my family. It genuinely does affect my anxiety and depression in a positive way. The world seems so fast and stressful for me all the time to the point where I literally talk to myself when I'm uncomfortable, yet when I'm high I feel fully in control and comfortable. I don't even sweat when I'm high, and typically sweating is a *major* cause for my anxiety cause I *always fucking sweat.*


Now, granted, until this year (have smoked for ~3 years) I didn't practice any self-control at all, which brings with it its own adverse side-effects (the ole' brain fog), but earlier this year I realized I was completely reckless with my drug abuse and don't even drink anymore, I just smoke pot.


Now I need to stop because if I get accepted for the job I was recently interviewed for, I need to get drug tested. The job is a stressful position working in a factory doing cleaning. It's good money, but for the environment (both physical environment, and the emotional environment created by the people I'd be working with) I'd be working in, I already know I'm not going to fit in. I genuinely hope they tell me I don't have the position, because then I wouldn't need to make an excuse to my parents for accepting something that isn't as good. I want something that gives me experience in a field I care about, not the same general labour work I've been doing for the past 3 years. I feel so stigmatized and claustrophobic working with the folks I've worked with, and it's genuinely not healthy for me, but I can't seem to make them understand. I'm trying to avoid resenting them, but they seem against giving me my independence.


The problem is, I know they mean well. They are genuinely loving parents, so it seems wildly inappropriate to just tell them ""No, I'm not doing this,"" and I worry it would create a rift between us. So I don't know what to do. I'm desperately looking for a position in something better but I know they're going to be upset with me, and I don't know what to do anymore. I hate being here, mentally, and I *hate* being here too, physically. Being at home makes me so tense. I have a place that I'm already paying rent for in the city, just let me be poor dammit, just care a little less please!. I prosper on my own. 


Edit: I should add, I had my interview for the position two days ago, so when I found out they'll drug test I stopped smoking. These past two days I had two episodes that for a while now I've feared have been partial seizures. They come and go but I've always correlated them with either being caused by low blood sugar OR potential epilepsy of some kind, cause I've had them my whole life in varying frequency. But the fact that it's happened twice in the last two days and I haven't smoked in two days has me upset too.

If I play like shit and get 3 it's usually because of a pre-made 3 or my philosophy for handing them out in this situation is.

""Nobody deserves my commendation.""

I get it though, I'm not able to see everything that goes on so maybe that healer or the dps actually deserved it and did something cool that someone saw or they just don't give a shit and don't actually hand them out because it's really only there for an ego booster and some (long-term) achievements.

pics,1,0,1,"&gt; no one gets my money now except registered charities.

Alas even many of those are fundamentally ""scam"" operations -- most of the money goes (in one way or another) to the people who operate the organization -- and very little actually gets spent on the people/cause that the charity is ostensibly organized to benefit.

I limit my own ""charity"" giving to two specific things:

1. To people who I know PERSONALLY (or am connected with in a ""friend of a friend"" manner) and where I am confident that: A) the need is real; B) the money will not be squandered; and C) the need is either due to some ""random/inadvertent"" thing, OR if it was due to ""bad decisions"" that there is at least some sense the ""lesson"" has been deeply learned (though I will admit that I've grown very cynical over the latter, I limit the assistance {and would rather provide advice and/or ""in kind"" help rather than money}; and moreover I make it clear that it is a ONE TIME thing.)

2. I give money to a local (well, kind of local, nearby metro area) ""rescue mission"" -- where I volunteered years ago, knew the people who ran it, and would vouch for the fact that they use every dollar as wisely as can be practically expected (there is no guarantee of ""success"" in what they do, but at least I know there is no corruption or needless waste or extravagance).

Beyond that... from what I have either personally seen, or else discovered via research... well just about everything else is (alas) more about some group of people capitalizing on the ""opportunity"" of some cause, rather than actually ""solving"" some problem (and in fact most organizations have an incentive not only for the problem to continue, but for it to get worse\* -- or at least for the PERCEPTION of the problem to be that it is getting worse -- Why? Because the worse it gets, the more money they can raise/skim.)

\* Once you really understand this, then you understand why (for example) all of the ""cancer"" charities push ""screening/early detection"" -- despite the fact that **all of the evidence** shows it is NOT actually helpful (i.e. it doesn't actually lengthen lives or decrease suffering) -- but what it DOES do is increase the PERCEPTION that ""cancer"" (or some specific cancer) is a major/increasing epidemic/problem... which can then be used to raise more funds (hire more people, do more campaigns, all of which justifies higher salaries &amp; perks for the people in charge, etc).",t3_3635vp,craxetn,t1_crap77c,t1_craxetn

Develope a plan with less interpretation involved.  This is the part I think I struggle with the most.  I feel as though the art of technical analysis is all about interpretation in the first place.  Finding divergences, are they strong enough, is the price at the right point compared to trend lines, support/resistance levels, moving averages, etc.  Then I get bits and pieces of all the stuff I've read about candlestick charting that gets into the mix.  Chart patterns, candlestick patterns.   Most of the time I have to reresearch what I think is a pattern to make sure I'm looking at it correctly.   So maybe I'm just trying to do too much analysis, which is causing the need to interpretate.  Whereas if I cut back on all the pieces involved I might be able to focus it down to more defined rules?

I'm currently on a long losing streak online and have been relegated to division four after three relegations in a row. And I drew my first game in that division too.

For instance, there is a lot more room for doubt when you start getting into stuff like how black holes work, or whether or not ""wormholes"" are a thing... But when it comes to stuff like how far away the moon is, or whether or not gravity is real, I tend to take the word of science over my own opinions pretty much 100%.

MortalKombat,4,0,4,"Outside of juggles, and perhaps certain capture states, command throws are in fact NEVER guaranteed to connect. That's the tradeoff for them being unblockable and dealing decent damage. Furthermore, most command grabs in this game are not very fast (compared to most 2D games) which means they can lose to random pokes unless they're performed from a frame advantage situation.


Command throws will not be able to connect while you are in any of these states:

* hitstun
* blockstun
* jumping
* invincible
* armor (the grab will ""connect"" but the actual throw won't come out and damage is miniscule)

Obviously the first two won't typically help you escape, but it's something you should be aware of. An opponent trying to land a command throw is very likely to try to condition you into blocking and staying on the defensive by hitting you with a couple of pokes. However, since the grab won't connect if you're still in block/hitstun, they'll have to give you the freedom to move in order to be able to land the throw.

Now, despite what I said about command throws being slow, you're still mostly not going to be reacting to them but rather try to predict when your opponent is going for a command throw, since the ways of escaping one are largely not very safe if you guess incorrectly. If you think your opponent is going for a throw, the basic defensive options are 1) Neutral jump, and 2) backdash. Jumping puts you out of harm's way, and you'll be able to land a jump punch launcher on your way down for a big combo punish. Backdashing works because they have invincible startup frames which means the grab will whiff, and even if your character has a lousy backdash, most command grabs have long enough recovery that you should be able to punish regardless.",t3_3692x9,crbubq8,t3_3692x9,t1_crbubq8

nfl,1,0,1,"I don't do fantasy football, but I suspect the problem with drafting him is that he's going to split receptions with Antonio Brown, Wheaton, and Le'Veon Bell.

We've been using Bryant in two ways:

* Early in the season, he was primarily a 'go' route. Long deep balls down the sideline, and since safety help tended to favor to AB's side, that usually leaves Bryant single covered. Good for long yards and TDs.

* Later in the season, someone realized that if you need 10 yards, you can run Bryant 12 yards and loft the ball up, and he'll come down with it. Almost used like Witten in Dallas - nothing fancy, just get the ball near him and let him make a play. He came down with TDs in the season finale against CIN and in the playoff game against BAL in that same basic style - just get him into the endzone and get the ball to him, let him catch it.

Will he catch balls? Yes Will he score TDs? Yes. Is he going to see 10 receptions a game? Probably not. Is he worth more fake points than some obscure WR on a shitty team where he's the only target? Who knows.

Fitness,-15,0,-15,"If your just starting out with lifting weights, do body weight exercises for like a month. Get used to feeling your muscles and becoming exhausted with targeting a specific muscle. I recommend picking up a total body fitness thing like the one chick Norris endorses. You can pick one up on Walmart.com for like 150. It will give you a solid workout using your own body weight, which I completely fine cuz chances are you can't lift your body weight push/pull if your just starting out. Feel the adrenaline and excitement of just working up a sweat, finish with some cardio and call it a night. Work in the mind muscle connection, that term is used a lot but I never understood it until about month 5 of working out. 

I will use biceps as an example, when you start out your ultimate goal is to just put up the weight. With this mind set you end up swinging the weight and using inertia to get the weight up. The problem with this is it becomes an upper body workout at that point. You use your back and shoulders instead of the bicep. 

When you can can control the weight and complete a full pump of just the bicep then your connection is forming. This concept works for all your muscles. When you look at the machines notes about what muscles it works and your connection is good then you will feel the burn in those muscles. 

This connection is terribly important with big muscle workouts like deadlifts for example. The reason being is that one tends to lift far more weight with this exercises and using the wrong ones could seriously injure you. 

If you cannot use correct form On a deadlift then don't do it. The same goes for any exercise really, anyways that's my two cents and I hope it Ella someone. ",t3_36bncr,crcmdte,t3_36bncr,t1_crcmdte

&gt; NEW DELHI: Warning of a cut in power supplies in the national capital, state-owned NTPC on Monday said Reliance Group owned distribution companies here have a history of payment defaults and their electricity supply would be curtailed if they fail to pay their dues by Monday. 


&gt; When asked for comments, power minister Jyotiraditya Scindia said: ""This issue is between DERC ( Delhi electricity regulatory commission), the distribution companies in Delhi and the state government, it is not for power ministry to comment but what we certainly do hope is that the dues rightfully in the case of NTPC should be paid as soon as possible."" 

&gt; However, the company added that there are no payment issues with Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited, another distribution company which supplies electricity in the national capital.

In a big city, sure, it's cheaper to rent an apartment with utilities included then it is to own a house. 

But in a small town? Mortgage plus utilities is often just as much or cheaper then the rent plus utilities. Especially in a town with 50 houses for sale and only 10 houses to rent. People who are renting out their houses often have a mortgage and are paying you extra on top of that, plus you have to pay for utilities. 

For example, in my town there are two identical houses right next to each other. And I mean identical, they are the same square footage and have the same layout. The only difference is the one I'm living in has a tree in the front yard. The rent on my house is $500 a month, plus about $300 a month for utilities, so the total bill every month comes to $800 a month. Next door, our neighbor's mortgage payments only come to $400 a month and assuming she spends the exact same amount on utilities, she saves $100 a month. ",t3_36chns,crcyjhl,t3_36chns,t1_crcyjhl

Warframe,1,0,1,"Yeah there are some decent shotguns, but aside from a few outliers which are ""good"" pretty much anything else is bound to have more weapons that are simply ""better.""    

I agree with your assessment though, best shotgun is probably Kohm or damage or Boar prime for 100% wide area status spewer.    

---------------------     

Btw Drakoon also has punchthrough, though IIRC it might be dependent on the charge level, the feedback from it isn't very good. Kohm having inherent punchthrough gives me an idea though. Currently the mod [for punchthrough] is 11 points stock. It would be a massive, and rather useful buff that really makes sense considering their role of crowd control to give shotguns inherent punch through.   

You still suffer from drop off and your damage being spread over a large area (potentially) so I don't think it would end up being *too* powerful before some inevitable tweaking.",t3_36dn2g,crd1oeg,t1_crd0u3j,t1_crd1oeg

It's not like the entire world collects other statistics the same way. The US and many countries in the EU have very different ways in collecting statistics on assault, for example. The US statistics on assaults only include aggravated assault, while some European countries include all forms of assault, France records something inbetween the two, and the UK just has a general ""violence against person"" statistic which includes robbery and rape (which are also recorded separately).

hearthstone,5,0,5,"As other's mentioned, priest cards are mostly combo cards which requires a setup and aren't as strong on their own, but the thing I think is the bigger problem is that Priest has no cost efficient removal and no burst damage.  The only other class that doesn't have cost efficient removal is Druid and they have Force / Savage combo for bust damage.  The only other class that doesn't have burst damage is Paladin and they have equality which is cost efficient removal.

People will say ""but Shadow Word: Pain / Death"" is cost efficient removal.  They are, however removal is only a 1 for 1 it's not as effective as something that removes 2 or more minions.

It would take too long to completely explain my thought process behind efficient removal vs not efficient removal, but lets just break it down to types of removal and explain why they are better or worse than the options priest have.

*--____--*

First is the ""hard"" *targeted* removal.  I'll include polymorph and Hex in this list:
Poly, Hex, Mind Control, Corruption, Naturalize, Siphon Soul, Assassinate, Crush

Then you have conditional targeted removal:
Execute, Shield Slam, SW:P, SW:D, Hemet, Hungy Crab, Sacrificial Pact, Doomsayer, Big Game Hunter, Stampeding Kodo, Cabal Shadow Priest

These are 1 for 1 removal effects although Mind Control is more of a 2 for 1, but it loses out of efficiency because it costs 10 mana.  Of all of these removals, Priest is weaker than other classes because, while cost efficient, their targeting restriction is stiffer than any other classes targeted hard removal making them much more situational and less flexible than other classes with the exception of corruption (takes too long to take effect) and naturalize (card advantage for the opponent)

*--____--*

Then you have the ""hard"" *untargeted* removal:
Deadly Shot, Vaporize, Tinkmaster, Sabotage

After that there's the AoE Damage cards (these are not **removal** since damage isn't guaranteed to remove anything:
Shadow Flame, Lightbomb, Holy Nova, Consecrate, Blizzard, Demonwrath, Lightning Storm, Arcane Explosion, Explosive Trap, Unleash the Hounds, Circle of Healing Soulpriest, Equality Conc/Pyro, Swipe, Flame Strike, Fan of Knives, Hellfire, Starfall, Blade Flurry, Dark Iron Skulker, Revenge, Ysera Awakens

Of the direct comparisons, Starfall, Consecrate, Blizzard, Explosive Trap, Dark Iron Skulker, Lightning Storm, Revenge and Demonwrath. Holy Nova has the second weakest mana cost to damage ratio only ahead of Blizzard. Starfall, while having the same cost to damage ratio, does not include a secondary effect. Blizzard, while costing 1 mana more, has a much more useful effect.

*--____--*

Finally we have the pure AoE removal cards:
Deathwing, Twisting Nether, Poison Seeds, Brawl

So the only real area that Priest has a efficient advantage is Hard Conditional Targeted remove with Pain, Death and Cabal.  In just basic hard removal, they lag behind because of how much mind control costs.  In AoE, their damage is par (2 damage), but the cost is prohibitive.  Since that is their only real AoE damage option (not including Pyro), they don't really have a choice in the matter.

*--____--*

Even after all of that, we have reusable removal, *weapons*.  Yes weapons are removal.  They can get 2 for 1 or more on creatures in many cases.  Having the ability to remove 2 or more cards in trade for some health is a trade that many can and do chose to make:  
Gorehowl, Truesilver, Ashbringer, Coghammer, Assassin's Blade, Perdition's Blade, Eaglehorn, Gladiator's Longbow, Death's Bite, Fiery Win Axe, Powermace, Doomhammer, etc

Obviously Priest has no weapons unless they run thoughtsteal mindvision or Blingtron so they aren't even given the option of trading life for card advantage.

*--____--*

The next point I'm going make is that gets the short end of the stick on healing.

For 6 mana, Priest does 5 damage and gains 5 life.  
For 6 mana, Warrior gets a 5/5 creature and gains 5 life.  
For 7 mana, Paladin gets a 5/6 creature and gains 6 life.  
For 7 mana, Druid gets a 5/5 creature and can either gain 5 life or draw 2 cards.  

Why can't Priest get a recurring source of damage (creature) for 6 mana?  I don't know.  Yes Priest does get the damage immediately unlike the other classes, but the board presence is a very important factor.  A card needs to be used to remove the Paladin and Warrior options.  No card needs to be used vs. the Priest option.

Light of the Naaru the the priest option for heal and get a creature.  The problem is 1. it's conditional (although not a difficult condition to fulfill) 2. it's only a 1/2.  It requires more cards / mana to be pumped into it to have an impact on the board.

*--____--*

Believe it or not, this factors into the burst damage issue that the Priest faces.  You can't stall out to build up your burst combo slowly like Mages or Warriors can do.  You don't have a good independent card draw engine like Rogues and Warlocks.  You don't have cost efficient non-conditional removal like Shaman/Paladin.  You don't get free creature generation like Paladin Shaman.  You don't have multiple creature generation like Paladin Hunter.  You don't have weapons.  You don't have class based charge minions like Warlock, Hunter, Druid, Warrior.  Your most cost efficient 2 for 1 removal is Shadow of Madness followed by Cabal.

*--____--*

**TL;DR** The lack of flexibility is really what holds Priest back.  Since almost every Priest card has a strict role that can't venture outside of their pre-defined values, it requires that you draw the correct card in the correct order to do what needs to be done.",t3_36d1ed,crdly4z,t1_crddi4t,t1_crdly4z

The Real Academy of the Spanish Language (In other words, the ruler of everything that has to do with spanish) disagrees with your Oxford dictionary. 

Is not an insult, it could be used as one, but in reality now days is not even used as that.

Is like calling a Japanese @Chinese@ and a lebanese @turco@. Is a colloquial name.


And the crab sentence, is a saying... that it seems I made the mistake, and does not exist in english... I tough it did since my aunt uses it in english... but probably she just translated from spanish.

And the last year or so, Nvidia's drivers have been absolutely horrid. They fix some problems, but cause more in their place, and I am not just bashing them for no reason. Their latest ingenious update to the GeForce experience causes my whole system to become unstable, and results in BSOD's every few hours, and driver crashes even more frequently.

And...

"" When Silva refused to make them with the message Jack wanted, offering instead to make the cakes without the message and to give Jack the supplies necessary to put whatever message he wanted on the cakes. In response, Jack filed a complaint with DORA's Civil Rights Division."" - from a linked article in the one you posted.

On the surface it seems that Phillips wouldn't make a wedding cake for a gay couple but offered to provide other bake goods while Silva offered to make a cake and allow Phillips to put whatever message on it he wanted. From that it seems like Silva objected to the message itself while Phillips objected to the form being delivered. On top of that if Silva's testimony is accurate and Phillips (or whoever had the message) hid the original message of ""God hates gays"" then I would easily side with Silva. Even without that at least Silva was offering to produce the same product as they would for anyone else without explicitly putting on the message requested while Phillips offered up a different product without any kind of real consolation.

TiADiscussion,4,0,4,"1. The point of BET is that the majority of television caters to white audiences. Having a single channel producing content specifically targeting black people isn't a big deal. Claiming that the idea of BET is racist and there needs to be a white version is ignorant of the larger situation and a knee-reaction.  

2. Yes, it's racist to say you'd never date an Asian guy. ""Asian"" is an incredibly wide-reaching term that covers an incredible diversity in people. To categorically dismiss ALL Asian people is racist.

I call bullshit on that finale.  Pym would have let Ultron die, not show mercy and suffer for it.


I am just hoping Rage of Ultron isn't canon.  (At first it was supposed to be, but now there seems to be less certainty of it.)   One of Pym's defining abilities is that he is a survivor.  Despite being around since the 60's, despite not having his own title, and being a big character to kill for shock value, without risking decreasing sales, Pym is one of the founding Avengers to never die (Hulk is the other,) despite almost every other Pym Particle user dying (Atlas being the only other exception) Pym continues on his flawed existence, beating the odds, and making himself more than what he was.

Thanks for taking the time to engage with voters in this format.  My question is relating to foreign policy, as I think most of the focus on your campaign has been in the area of domestic policy.

What is your philosophy on fighting terrorism?  Clearly groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS have a determination to organize and attack us at home in the US and attack our interests abroad.

seduction,1,0,1,"&gt; The reality is the less you give a fuck, the more people like you. Ever hear of 'girls like assholes'? Well, it's true, only because those assholes simply don't give a fuck and are doing whatever makes them tick. 

This is so wrong on so many levels. First, women do not like assholes they put up with them thinking they can be the one to change him into something more refined. ""Bad boys"" bring out women's nurturing nature. Also, ""bad boys"" are selfish and only focus on what they want regardless of the consequences, this to many women appear as confidence when it's nothing more than ruthless narcissism. Assholes ""don't give a fuck "" they do indeed ""give a fuck"", except it's they only care about themselves. Advising men to ""not give a fuck"" is piss poor advice as it teaches men to be narcissistic , selfish and ultimately vapid creatures with no depth.


The better advice is clarify one's values, understand what actions align these values and focus on that, not on what others think about your values. By focusing on that you will create a space where other opinions do not faze you, as you already know what your about and what you want to accomplish.

b) Give the stuff only to the people that bought the ""Pre-order edition"" or ""special edition"".

They know that games today are for the most part tied with micro-transactions, they know gamers hate that, they are giving these micro-trans away for free every week because yes, gamers hate micro-transactions, but not the free ones, gamers love free stuff.

IAmA,1,0,1,"&gt;Why did Kuwait lend Iraq money in the 80's?

Why? Because Kuwait feared Iranian influence in the region and the Baathists in Iraq were able to play the role of ""enemy of my enemy."" 

&gt;Can you provide any links that show that the slant drilling was never verified and largely dismissed?

You want me to prove a negative? That's a fundamental logical fallacy. [There is this](http://www.nytimes.com/1990/09/03/world/confrontation-in-the-gulf-the-oilfield-lying-below-the-iraq-kuwait-dispute.html?pagewanted=2)

''The issue of oil taken from the Rumaila field is only a smokescreen to disguise Iraq's more ambitious inten tions,'' said Marvin Zonis, a professor of political economy at the University of Chicago's Graduate Business School. ''The Iraqis will claim anything to jus tify the incorporation of Kuwait.''

Some Iraqi officials have accused Kuwait in the past of using advanced drilling techniques developed by Amer ican oilfield specialists to siphon oil from the Rumaila field, a charge that American drillers deny, noting that the oil flows easily from the Rumaila field without any need for these techniques.

The Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, with headquarters in London, acquired American drilling expertise when it bought the Santa Fe International Cor poration in 1981 for $2.4 billion. Santa Fe, based in Alhambra, Calif., has separate divisions that specialize in oil field drilling and rig operations, pri marily in offshore areas around the world, as well as in exploration and production, mostly in the Gulf of Mexi co, Texas and Louisiana.

Six American Workers

John J. Mika, Santa Fe's vice presi dent of administration, said six Santa Fe employees, all Americans, were among the oil workers captured by Iraqi troops in the early moments of the Aug. 2 invasion. All of the men were believed taken to Baghdad, he added.

The Santa Fe employees worked on several rigs ''immediately adjacent'' to the Iraqi border, Mr. Mika said. He added that he was unaware of any well that might have utilized the ''slant'' drilling technique along the Iraqi bor der.

W. C. Goins, senior vice president of OGE Drilling Inc., a Houston company that provided oilfield supervisors and workers for Kuwait in the same area, said he was ''positive'' all of the wells his employees drilled and operated ran vertically down to the Rumaila pay zone. ''That field crosses the border in north Kuwait,'' he added. ''Iraqis were drilling on one side, and Kuwaitis on the other side.''",t3_36j690,creozxz,t1_cremmzj,t1_creozxz

Everyone is more than welcome in our neck of the woods, but the second someone gets whacked with a shocking statement they make a thread similar to yours complaining about the jerks in zen when they don't even understand the culture of what's going on.

We're not a hand holding bunch because the history of zen is the antithesis of hand holding. Its getting hit with a stick, a finger chopped off, killing cats, and so on.

I tend to think of it as ""hard"" Buddhism. A Buddhism that is deeply rooted in the reality of things as opposed to thinking that reincarnation is a literal thing and not a metaphor.

There's no shame in having augmented breasts; my point is that most of what the media offers us as ""ideal"" is unrealistic.

Just ring them up and explain how you think that is unfair (it is). If they are adament (they shouldn't be) then state you wish to make a formal complaint and for them to send you their complaint procedures.

Also mention you're a student in 'financial hardship' which this is adding to. This is a buzz word for banks. 

You basically want to call their bluff. Complaints cost banks a lot of money. Any complaint to Obudsman costs the bank atleast £500, regardless of whether they were in the right ot not. They know this and so they try and settle complaints quickly.

Not sure how i feel giving a ranged capable class same unarmored  buff barbarians get ( atleast I think it's that bonus) but I do feel the rp side of this or an intelligent  player can abuse this. Eg I walk into a stream in combat and I become obscured in steam.

I think this is gonna come down to coaching.   Its not always about the best 1 on 1 matchups, this is not just a curry vs harden game, despite the storylines.

Agreed that Learning is stupid, I'm still not quite sure what it does.

Disagree about Intrigue being categorically bad. It is bad for most of a human player's game, where he is managing a large empire. However, I think Intrigue can be good for players starting out as lowly Counts in the Byzantine Empire. With the AI passing Crown Authority increases very quickly (I've seen them get to Absolute more than once) and Imperial Administration allowing free Duchy revocation, blobbing through warfare is difficult in the Byzantine Empire. Intrigue will help you plot-kill the people you need to spread your dynasty, and becoming Spymaster can help you do some serious damage to the Emperor's court.

It's much more situational than the other 3, but I think Intrigue definitely has its uses.",t3_36k32f,crfcqsx,t1_crf17la,t1_crfcqsx

• Proof of service of ANY contact you have made with me in any form. 
• The amount that you say I owe. 
• A detailed and itemized explanation as to how you arrived at the amount I am currently told by your company that I owe to you. 
• A signed copy of the original loan agreement or application or contract. 
• A complete history of my payments beginning with my original creditor. A screen print from your computer does not suffice. 
• A copy of your license to operate as a collection agency in the state of xxxxxx ) 
• And the name and address of your Registered Agent in the State of xxxx. Though not required you’re probably going to need to send it.

OR Remove the offending entry from all credit reporting agencies.

Reporting information that you know to be inaccurate, or failing to report information correctly, violates the FCRA. 
Should you pursue a judgment without validating this debt, or not provide the information as required by law, I will inform the court and request the case be dismissed based on your failure to comply with the FDCPA and FCRA.

If you do NOT own the rights to collect this debt, I demand that you immediately send a copy of this dispute letter to the original creditor that you say I owe money to so they are also aware of my dispute with this debt.

Any attempt to collect this debt without completely validating it violates the FDCPA and FCRA and that I am recording keeping all correspondence concerning this matter.

If I am denied credit or employment as a result of this I may seek damages in federal court.

Your malicious, defamous and libelous entry is causing irreparable harm to my reputation and income producing ability plus inflicting emotional harm and duress as a result.

The risk to reward just aint worth it, cos the Gestapo at most festivals definitely will get you (talkin UK here, but could apply anywhere).

eldertrees,0,0,0,"&gt; It's past the point where your developmental growth could even possibly be inhibited by cannabis usage (and it'd have to be FAR heavier than once per day after 9pm).

I totally agree. Although technically my brain isn't fully developed until mid to late 20's, moderate cannabis use as in small doses once a day, shouldn't do anything to hinder my brain's developmental functions. I'm not a neuroscientist or anything, but I've done my fair share of cannabis research, and I've not come across one study or article that warns against light to moderate daily use interfering with brain development of someone in their 20's. Teenagers, yes I hear studies all the time about how heavy use as a teenager could potentially cause IQ reduction later on in life, but NEVER about anyone who's already in their 20's.

RedditBandits,2,0,2,"I think we should become a serious war clan but not do 24/7 wars. It will pressure people and not everyone has the time for that. People want to farm too. We should keep the 6 wars a week 2 mandatory, but be more serious with kicking bad attackers. Having the same amount of wars, but being more serious about them will allow us to win more wars. Only having 2 mandatory wars per season will allow people to have time to farm troops, heroes, etc. If we turn into a great hardcore war clan, we might lose some of our great attackers, and people won't have as much time to farm and get war troops and heroes up. Basically, we have constant wars where only 2 are mandatory. We will just take war more seriously.

teslore,13,0,13,"No, Imperial Guide published 2E 864 names the Reach as a Hold of Skyrim, though the piece of land that is specifically Markarth city could have been bought later. Important to note that only the city of Markarth Side actually appears in Arena. Aside from saying it's a continuity error(which is a lame lore answer), I'm gonna shoot out a barely substantiated theory. 

So the name Markarth Side implies that Markarth is both a known place, and is beside of the city. That fits as Markarth Side is situated near, though not exactly in the same place as, modern-day Markarth. As for Markarth being a ruin, I would say that isn't likely, as Tiber Septim chartered a new school for the Way at the same time as the Pocket Guide was published. That school was suppose to be established in Markarth, so I suspect it was a real city. 
Finnally we come to what I think is the case (aside from the obvious continuity error). I think it's probable that Markarth was under control of the Reachmen. There is precedent for this. The Reachmen were actually very powerful at one time, they even conquered the White-Gold Tower for a while during the interregnum. If fact, Tiber Septim was fighting the Reachmen at Hroldon, before be summoned by the Greybeards, so during his time they were obviously a pretty big player in Skyrim. In fact, I would even suspect that until Tiber Septim was recognized as Emperor by the Nords, the Reach was an independent kingdom, ruled by the Reachmen. Then Septim takes the Reach and gives it to the Nords, but without Imperial support the Nords wouldn't be able to hold it. During the Great War, when the Empire was busy, the Reachmen were able to take Markarth, so I presume Nord rule is heavily dependent on the Empire. 
That takes us to Arena, which takes place during the Imperial Simulacrum, a time when Imperial authority declined. The Nords were also fighting High-Rock and Hammerfell at the time and maintaining costly occupations of key cities in both those provinces. So I would say Markarth isn't a Hold capital during that time because the Reachmen have taken it back. You can't go there because, well, why would you? Have you seen what those guys get up to?",t3_36p3y8,crfwce1,t3_36p3y8,t1_crfwce1

Gender_Critical,5,0,5,"&gt; But there is a whole group (probably most of the people on this sub) whose argument is that they just don't want to be near trans women because they find them distasteful or ridiculous or just plain don't like them. It always sounds like the right people here are defending is ""the right to not be around trans women because....ew"".

I don't see posts like that around here. Quite a few of us (myself definitely included) know trans people (M2T and F2T both), work with these people, know these people as fellow human beings, and are perfectly polite and friendly with them, because, well, fellow human beings. There is no ""ew"" going on, at least not on my part.

I do see posts that find the currently popular trans ""origin story"" ridiculous, but that is not at all the same thing. 

The problem is that the current trans ""origin story,"" the whole ""born in the wrong body"" ""always been a woman"" ""brain intersex"" ""female brain"" idea, fundamentally contradicts with the entire basis of traditional feminism.

The entire enterprise relies on the idea that there is a ""proper"" ""matching"" relationship of thought processes and personality to genitalia, such that someone can have these two things, brain and bits, either ""on the same side"" or ""on the opposite side.""  In all the endless conversations about this, we hear constantly that ""cis"" (i.e., non-""trans"") people are supposedly all content with our ""gender identity.""

Problem is? Most women I know, certainly ones I talk to, and most definitely myself, don't have any sense of ""gender identity.""  I don't ""feel like a woman."" I was TOLD I'm a woman, due to my genitalia, and that's the entire end of the story, I do not have any more voluntary input into that than I do my race. 

...and yes, I know, we hear this ""you just can't feel it because you're 'cis.'""  Sorry, but I'm gonna call shenanigans on that, and I'm not alone. Plenty of times there's posts by trans people asking ""cis"" people who wander into trans spaces the rhetorical ""how do you know you're a guy"" (it's usually men for some reason) and the ""cis"" people pretty much always answer ""what? I have a penis. That's how I know.""  I.e., same thing. They realize that their bodies determined what category they were slotted into, and that was the end of the story. No feelz involved.

I do not believe in any sort of ""proper"" or ""matching"" relationship of thought process or personality or emotions to genitalia. You have a brain, you have a body, they're a valid combination, as a human being, that's it, and we have tremendous variation.  Whatever you do, however your brain is, it's a valid pattern for ""someone born with a penis"" to have. YOU define what those parameters of ""how people born with a penis can be,"" as a member. (But yes, I understand that being an outlier can lead to some intense social pressure.)

Back to the conflict with feminism.

This ""born in the wrong body"" or ""intersex brain"" thing also relies on their being a certain ""women's way of thinking,"" or should I say ""people born with vaginas way of thinking.""  Why? Because someone who is born with a penis, but feels out of place or strange, suddenly identifies this certain thought pattern (or patterns) as surely being ""patterns that people born with vaginas usually have."" (This despite the fact that there is NO WAY for someone born without a body part to even ever KNOW what someone born with it ""feels like"" inside. You simply can't know ""what it would feel like"" to be someone else.)

That is an obvious conflict with feminism. Feminists have fought forever against this idea that there is a ""way that women think"" or worse yet that there's a ""woman's way of thinking"" and it's all about HORMONES. It's sexist tripe of the worst sort, and now we see it being revived under the guise of pseudoscience with a shiny ""progressive"" veneer.  Is it really all that surprising that traditional feminists find the ""brain sex"" idea ridiculous?

You can't honestly say that you have no preconceptions of how women think, or how women ""are,"" and at the same time think that you can identify some pattern in yourself that would cause you, someone not born female, to be a woman.

Just because someone born male feels strange about his body or feels that he's not matching up with social requirements of masculinity or gender rules, that does not mean that ""well, if I don't fit 'man,' I must be 'woman.'"" 

Would ""transitioning"" and passing as a woman, having strangers on the street think you're female and thus respond to you as they do females help with dysphoria? Quite possibly, as people here admit all the time. You want the bodymods? Fine, it's a free country. 

It's just the current origin story, the ""we're truly female in the brain, always been women from birth"" that's the offensive part.

As for the bathroom thing: First we have to admit that the bathroom troubles are an issue for NON-PASSING people. If you pass, no one is going to say word one about you using the bathroom because they're not gonna know you're trans.

Then, when we're talking about non-passing people, the issue is not that they as individuals are there to creep in the bathroom. The problem is, they often don't look any different from people who ARE there to creep in the bathroom.  

So the current push for ""you should never complain about what look like creepers in the bathroom"" means that there might be a creeper in the bathroom, but you can't raise any alarm, because you'd be POTENTIALLY offending some poor trans woman.  

It's an issue of do you err on one side, or the other? Not about insisting that ""truly trans"" people are the ones creeping in the bathroom. ",t3_36o6d1,crfxuq5,t1_crfvhg1,t1_crfxuq5

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

We're priced to sell, so we don't offer deals like some of the other local B&amp;Ms that are usually 10-25% more than we are (e.g. We sell Aspire premium kits for $59.99, where another local shop (13 miles/15 minute drive away) sells them for $79.99).

insomnia,1,0,1,"I've struggled with dry eyes and eye strain that are likely insomnia-related, getting so bad at times that I've spent hours during the day keeping my eyes closed due to pain. Been examined by multiple ophthalmologists but they've only been able to treat the symptoms. 

I would recommend seeing an opthamologist to get your eyes checked for nearsightedness, dry eyes, myasthenia gravis, etc. 

What makes my situation difficult is that my eye problems impede my sleep, creating sort of a negative feedback loop.

It seems all my symptoms get better or worse depening on my sleep, but it takes time for better sleep to ""trickle down"" to my eye health. 

You need to find some activities that are easy on the eyes, preferably with lot's of long-distance seeing to relax your cilliary muscles. If you don't take it easy on your eyes when you feel pain, you can prolong the strain. Activities to avoid when strained are reading, looking at computers/screens, and driving. 

You can also try out the 20-20-20 rule, or every 20 min, look 20ft away for 20 sec. I find that breaks of a few min help better. Also try out Gunnar computer glasses that use a yellow tint to improve contrast and have a slight magnification. Lastly get a bigass computer monitor and run a low resolution so you can sit further back and still read text easily. I use a 27"" at 1280x720.

I was being blatantly lied to (claiming that I had missed the boat on the car ""I wanted"" by waiting a week - I never even drove that car or expressed interest in it).  I don't understand how guilt tripping me with made up information is supposed to rush me into buying.  I never expected a salesperson to be so manipulative.  (I assume this individual is an exception but maybe not?)

This is my first time buying from a dealer so I tried to give the benefit of the doubt and not assume this person would take advantage of my naivety.  I imagined they would try to instill trust and comfort but rather it was pressure and at times demeaning. Luckily I have family members who have sold cars and friends who have some experience coaching me. 

My SO's face as I was getting fed up and looked to him with my ""I'm getting fed up"" face is an image I will cherish for the rest of my years. I am glad for the experience though and knowing I can walk away (and having done it!) is a great comfort.  ",t3_36pnp0,crgafay,t1_crg3ppi,t1_crgafay

There are exceptions - some bosses have well-known but unmarked AoEs (eg, coincounter), lots of bosses will randomly target a party member who doesn't have hate (eg, the bubbles which surround someone in brayflox), and especially trials and end-game bosses can have some level of party-wide unavoidable AoEs from minor damage or bleeds which can be mostly ignored to significant damage which needs two healers providing heavy party-wide mitigation (eg, Odin)

Also, as healer, if DPS keeps pulls hate and the tank doesn't get it back, then from your PoV they're now the tank. Hopefully they know what to do with it, but it's effectively your job to keep them alive now (unless triage says they need to die, because dying is a great way to drop aggro) If they're pulling hate because of a gear difference then they may actually be better equipped to tank than the tank is and as such are easier to heal.",t3_36okrd,crgkizf,t1_crg8khd,t1_crgkizf

IAmA,5,0,5,"Thanks for this. This has more or less been my thinking on it, though I'm maybe a little more nervous than you on the chances of a full reauthorization getting through by the strategic error of Patriot Act opponents.

Maybe you can answer this question: say Patriot Act opponents get everything they want - full sunset on the affected portions. How will the surveillance state overseers respond? Will they just get some John Yoo-esque lawyer to come in and desperately wrangle authority out of other parts of the law, keeping the status quo going? Will they actually give in and shut down the relevant programs?

It seems to me that even the Church Committee ultimately did little to slow the machine down (let alone the rejected Pike report), after all, and that was a time of great anger toward it, probably the greatest anger there has ever been. I remember Glenn Greenwald in a recent interview somewhere saying he stopped writing as much about the legal aspects of these programs because officials would time and time again just work around the law to get whatever they needed.

To that end, is relying on party politics, filibusters and insider horse-trading on things like the USA Freedom Act (or even depending on sunset clauses) going to be ultimately effective? I'm thinking we need a serious independent popular movement to really make traction in the long run, or else it will be one step forward, two steps backward. As we speak we have Australians, the French, the British and even the Canadians bulking up their own security states.

&gt;It is just a rigorous examination of the methodologies used in many, many studies on false rape accusations.

It's hard to quantify whats true or false on situation like alleged rape. It's her words against his words. So no matter the methodology or rigor or due diligence, it's impossible to determine a number with exactitude. And even then, there's also no reports that can prove that false accusation doesn't exist or that it only happen on rare occasion. 

http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-09-19/how-many-rape-reports-are-false

&gt;The number of false accusations is what statisticians call a “dark number” -- that is, there is a true number, but it is unknown, and perhaps unknowable. 

&gt;What we know is that we don’t know. We should not presume that every rape victim is telling the truth because it would make it easier for victims to come forward. Nor should we presume that every rape accusation has a 50 percent chance of being false. We should look at the facts in each case and judge them with the knowledge that some women do lie about rape -- for revenge, to cover up some problem in their own lives, to get attention and sympathy from others. And also with the knowledge that men lie, too, violating their victims a second time in order to cover up their crimes. And that while men have gone to jail for rapes they did not commit, many other men have avoided the jail time they deserved for terrible crimes against women.

WTF,20,0,20,"UK doc here. Legally we can't kill somebody, otherwise it's considered murder. However iirc no doctor has ever been convicted of mercy killing in the UK, even though there are some very obvious cases that have gone to court. One springs to mind where a doctor literally injected the patient with a lethal dose of potassium chloride, prescribed it as you would any other drug, and told the nurse exactly what he was doing - he was still found not guilty at trial. A disabled baby I think, if memory serves.

Anyway, legally no patient can demand any treatment from a doctor, their only right is to refuse it. This includes resuscitation. So we can refuse to do CPR if we don't think it will change anything, even if the patient disagrees. This is rarely the case however and we often follow the wishes of family and the patient when making this decision. But it is common to refuse to admit a patient to higher level care (ICU) if the doctors think they will die anyway, because the interventions wouldn't change anything. 

Also, there is a legal caveat that we can give palliative treatment that will inevitably hasten death as long as it's primary purpose is to reduce suffering. So for example, if you are dying in excruciating pain and it will take an hour for you to pass, we can give a large dose of morphine that will kill the pain but also cause you to die in 10 minutes. That drug has caused death quicker, but it's purpose wasn't to kill, but to end suffering. 

As doctors our job isn't just to cure illness and keep people alive, but essentially so what is best for our patients. The law ties our hands in some ways (euthanasia) but not so much in others. Actually one of the hardest parts of training as a doctor is learning how to say no and admit defeat, especially if it's gonna cause the patient to die quicker.",t3_36sc7b,crgt6sz,t1_crgritw,t1_crgt6sz

Games,1,0,1,"I had the early impression that the game runs very well on my system, but that has changed a bit and I've had to spend some time to find a sweet spot, but that feels currently impossible.  

White orchard was fine most of the time, I had the game at around  60 fps outdoors in forests etc. and 50 to 60 in towns and settlements.  
Later on in Velen noticed that framerate drastically dropped to 45 or so in houses, huts even, that had a few people inside. Interestingly the biggest change here was Water quality, dropping that from Ultra to Low gained me the missing 25 frames per second. I settled for medium in the end, it was close enough to 60. Said town was by a pool of water, but it was not immediately visible from the building.  

Once again I was running at a ""stable"" 50 to 60 frames, but for the first time there was a bit bigger scene where I fought about 6 people and their horses were standing around too. This again dragged my frames to 40-45. What helped was lowering foliage distance. Again I was running at 50-60 fps in any situation.  

Aaaand a bit later I encountered a small patch of flames after an explosion at nighttime. It was nothing impressive, just some flames, but those forced my frames to 40-45 and I was unable to make them much higher even lowering all settings as a test.  

Some notes of performance:  
- Everywhere I've read so far, people tend to say that Water quality is a minor hit on performance, but I'd suggest testing it for yourself. Lowering it gave me a drastic fps boost.  
- Higher texture quality indeed does not seem to do much, can happily keep it at High/Ultra. VRAM usage still seems low.  
- Foliage distance is a heavy setting. Density not so much.  

I think Witcher 3 is finally a game that marks the beginning of an era where I can no longer trust my reliable ol' 3GB 7970 GHz edition to run all games on at least High settings at 1080p @ 60 fps. Feels like some improvements can still be made by patching the game or optimizing GPU drivers(I havent' tried the Leaked 15.5 catalysts)as the performance can feel a bit random, like very impressive looking vistas with several characters on the screen and numerous light shafts can work just fine, but something puny like a small flame or a couple of smelly peasants inside a hut can run much worse.  
I can play the game just fine, but I hope I can eventually reach a framerate that does not go below 50 at any time at medium(ish) settings, I think that's reasonable.

Other than that, I think the game looks simply amazing. So much stuff happening on the screen, the lighting, weather effects.. I'd go as far and say that TW3 is top3 best lookers in video games.  
Also with the very lowest settings with effects disabled, I thought the game still managed to look good, so if you think you can get a suitable framerate at a good resolution without all the bells and whistles but scared the game would look like a mess, it should be fine.

My point is, that if your store is anything like mine, don't expect much and you can't be let down.  If you have issues,  take them up with your ETL-HR( behind closed doors) they should be able to at least listen to your concerns.

Also bauxite is of course more valuable since farming it is a pain (all expeditions are either low yielding or very long) and buckets are easy to obtain (expedition 2 all day every day) and you don't really spend them much outside of events/EO if you have the maps cleared. At some point buckets just stop being a problem and bauxite is always a headache if you do bauxite-intensive crafting.

summonerschool,2,0,2,"For mid lane play Ahri and Talon. Ahri's scaling is so incredibly strong and I feel she is really under-rated. I will always pick Ahri into a blind matchup, and I keep Talon reserved for counter-picks or skill-matchups. Once you're into the mid-late game with Ahri you will find yourself chunking Nasus' and Sejuani's for 1/4 HP with a single Q.

The reason I like Ahri as a pick when you don't know your opponent is because she is ranged so she can still CS safely and just scale into the late game. If you see the enemy team pick something like Annie/Kassadin/Cassopeia mid then pick Talon. Talon is so unbelievably strong and hugely under-rated IMO, I would actually say he is significantly stronger than Zed in a team fight (and basically just as good at picking off squishes 1v1).

Of course if Katarina isn't banned and I'm not 1st/2nd pick then I will just pick Katarina. I mained Katarina all of season 4 and she is by far my favorite champion (and regardless of how low her skill floor may or may not be I still honestly feel like her skill cap is higher than most people think, because the number of ways to outplay people in a major team fight with flash + shunpo + resets + 2 charges on your yellow trinket are limitless).

news,1,0,1,"No, you don't have that in League.

In diamond, dragons only get contested for the first time MAYBE at 10 minutes, unless you get the rare jungler who goes for it earlier. 

Baron is almost never worth going for because it can throw the game or get you less than pushing their inhib down when they're aced.

People barely contest blue or red buffs, and 90% of the time that isn't the whole team on both sides contesting buffs.

Meanwhile in Heroes of the Storm, the first objective spawns between 50 *seconds* and 1:50.

Again, the part of League that truly takes skill is team fighting. And it doesn't happen very often.

DotA 2has denying CS, true. But DotA 2 also cripples the fun factor by restricting skill usage heavily due to mana constraints, no recall and weak towers. It also has a less-than-enjoyable UI, and I say this as someone who used to play the *original* DotA.

I would not argue that DotA takes more skill than Heroes of the Storm **and** League of Legends. But I would argue that it isn't as fun as either of those two because of the flaws with it.

DebateAChristian,1,0,1,"&gt;Crucially, the Biblical mandate of obedience extends far beyond God.

Ultimate fealty is owed only to God. 

&gt;What was the moral and ethical takeaway from the Nuremburg trials? Unmistakably, the lesson was that obedience to legitimate authority isn't always justifiable, defensible, and good 

To human authority, perhaps. 

&gt;Does the Bible, at any point, issue Nuremberg caveats regarding obedience? I'd argue that the Abraham-Isaac lesson positively rules out such caveats!

There was a time when it was ""morally abhorrent"" to suggest freeing slaves. Were Christian abolitionists evil because they insisted on following eternal decrees from God? 

&gt;In mandating unconditional obedience to legitimate authority

The reality is that they needed to create a market for OLED manufacturing, and just making them flat, no consumer is going to buy one when they're more expensive and slightly less bright (1st gen) that comparable LCDTVs.

Making them curve adds perceived value to a consumer, even if that value is not a real thing, so they sell more, so they manufacture more, making up the costs of the new factories and helping to keep margins up for the more lucrative smart phone markets.

That's why they're curved.

ApplyingToCollege,1,0,1,"Hi, I'm not really sure where I want to apply, but I'm wondering if someone can give me information on schools that I could get into with my credentials. I think that I would like to get into marketing or sociology.  Also, I am an Asian female junior at a public high school.

GPA: ~96/100 UW

Class Rank: Most likely within the top 10 to 15.

SAT: 1850 (670 CR, 630 M, 550 W). (It's kind of low, but I'm still really happy. I will retake it in the fall and study more.)

APs: World History (3), this year I took USH &amp; Eng. Comp. Next year I am planning on taking Calc AB and Gov. 

Honors/Local College Classes: Living Environment (9), English (10), Spanish (11), and Precalc (11).  Next year I plan on taking SUPA English. 

ECs: 

* Volunteering at library and various other places (~75 hours)

* Playing the flute, guitar, and alto saxophone (and an honors band for one year, first chair/section leader for one year as well)

* Treasurer of Book Club

* Member of GFTS (a community service club)

* Manager of a Youtube channel for a semi-well known online platform

* Member of NHS

* JV/Varsity tennis (there is no JV team for my school, but I am not on the Varsity line up)

* Designing the website for a local town's Parks and Rec. page

* Math tutor

* I won 4th place in a bridge building competition in 8th grade (hahaha can I use this?  This is the only award I've ever won.)

I hopefully will be able to get an internship at my library over the summer as well.  

I'm thinking of applying to Drexel, Emerson, or PhilaU.  Northeastern is a super reach.  I've been told that I should look into the West Coast for more Asians (I am adopted and live in a very white community, so I want to meet more Asians/learn more about Asian American communities).  I am very conflicted over what schools I want and schools I can actually get into. Therefore, I was wondering what type of schools I could get into?  Especially if my SAT grades increase.  Also, I am very worried because I'm Asian and I hear that schools hold Asians to a higher standard.  Thank you for reading this :)",t3_36dil7,cri3z5f,t3_36dil7,t1_cri3z5f

We also live in a huge city, so it hasn't impacted my other friendships at all.

I think a card is the right way to go, I would never mention us and you're right to emphasize that. Also her mum is sort of (locally) famous and I'm worried that the card would get lost or even not know who it's from (her mum is very scatterbrained and I haven't been consistently in the picture for about 4 years now), and I'm wondering if I should send it to where she lives now instead. 

Thanks for the advice!

EDIT: I also get what you mean about not making it about me and I feel I might have made it seem like that's what I did about the letter I sent after the break up. It was sort of along the lines of, ""Hey, I heard about the breakup with so-and-so. I'm so sorry that that happened and I can't imagine what you must be feeling right now. You will always be best and oldest friend, I love you very very much, and if you ever want to talk (no matter what the time) I'm always here for you. No matter what's happened between us.

fantasyfootball,1,0,1,"10 teams, mostly standard scoring (5pt passing TDs), **2QB**, Yahoo league. I am allowed to keep 3 players and may keep them forever at the same price. Anyone kept in the same round as another player takes up your draft pick in the round before, unless you have multiple picks in that round.

I currently have two 3rd round picks, no 8th round pick, and two 9th round picks, and no 15th or 16th round pick. This means my last pick is in round 14/16. I have the #1 overall pick in the draft.

My best options are: 

* Jamaal Charles - 1st round

* **Aaron Rodgers - 2nd round**

* **Dez Bryant - 2nd round**

* Alshon Jeffery - 3rd round

* Randall Cobb - 4th round

* **C.J. Anderson - last available pick**

* **Travis Kelce - last available pick**

* **Adrian Peterson - last available pick**

* Justin Forsett - last available pick

* **Nick Foles - last available pick**

* Victor Cruz - last available pick

I've highlighted my 5 favorite guys here, and I'd like some feedback. My current line of thinking is that since I have the #1 overall pick, I can basically keep four players if I desire to grab one of them at #1, probably Charles. Then, since it's a 2QB league, keeping Rodgers forever in the second round is super valuable. After that, Peterson and Anderson both look to be high ranking backs for next year that I can keep super late.

So, it has to be planned before it can be called murder, spur of the moment counts as manslaughter. Ofcourse, context does matter, killing a random guy will get you a far heavier penalty than killing a guy your wife was cheating with.

While Outlast mostly just made me feel tense, which went away at about the halfway mark once I figured out the enemy AI, the story and atmosphere of the game kept it  enjoyable.

Alien: Isolation was just beautifully done. It hit all the right beats for a fan of the original movie, it looked great, it played well, it was well written, and it kept me on the edge of my seat white knuckling the controller the whole time.

The Evil Within could have been on here, as it was also very well done, but their various attempts to make the game feel more cinematic completely broke the immersion for me, which severely hamstringed all of the scares and creepiness of the game.",t3_36zhc5,criosg5,t3_36zhc5,t1_criosg5

Another couple may decide in their contract that they will not have sex at all. Neither has a paper contract, so because the government has given a stiff and plain old boring definition of what marriage is, the presumption is that anyone getting married has to play by the government's rules, and thus a couple who have multiple partners is operating outside of that dusty old government definition.

Naruto,1,0,1,"**Ninja Info:** Born and trained in Kumogakure, his unique style became popular among the village. After various task from assassination to being a bodyguard, he sets out to tests his abilities and is looking for strong people to fight.

**Name:** Eoi the silent

**Village Affiliation:** Village Hidden in the Clouds

****

**Chakra Type:** 

*Primary Type:* Wind

*Secondary Type:* Lightning

****

**Kekkai Genkai:** Sound mastery

****

**Equipment:** 4 kunai, 6 shuriken, 2-2 smoke and flash bombs, 10 paper bombs, a bow and 20 arrows in a quiver on his back

****

**Jutsus:**

*Lightning style: Flashy arrows* - Generates arrows from lightning chakra which travel extremely quick when released. They explode and shock on impact, dazing enemies hit for a second.

*Wind style: Silent steps* - When in combat, he uses this technique to move around. Because of his mastery of sounds his steps become silent, and the first initial step when starting a movement after being still makes him blink a 3 meter distance. This is a low effort technique, making use of the surrounding air, allowing him usage for even an hour if necessary, but its only used while on the move.

*Sound technique: Endearing tone* - A genjutsu ability. He whistles a very high and loud tune using his chakra, which spreads in a 50 meter radius around him. Because of the sound traveling, he knows the location of enemies who are struck by it. Whoever hears the tune becomes immobilized for 3 seconds, but he can't use this ability more than once every 30 seconds. 

****

**Awakening:** 

*Unbearable sound* - He empowers his sound abilities and helps him avoid close combat.
Stat boost: +1 INT +1 NIN

Passive: Creates a strong wind around him in a 2 meter radius. Anyone trying to get closer to him enters the wind and hears an unbearable tone, causing them to be immobilized for a second and knocked back slightly.

****
 
**Stats:** 

Strength: 1

Speed: 3

Intelligence: 9

Ninjutsu: 8

Endurance: 4

****

**Strategy:** His first use of his genjutsu is only to know the whereabouts of the enemy and he creates strategies from that info. With his movements and knowledge of the targets location its easy to avoid close combat (awakening if necessary). Uses projectiles to fight, and takes advantage of his genjutsu and the 100% hit on an immobile target. ",t3_36wd8l,crj9obb,t3_36wd8l,t1_crj9obb

- register for selective service (go to the post office and ask for the form)
- Figure out where your birth certificate, social security card, child passport (if your family ever traveled abroad when you were under 18) and all other documents related to your legal existence are so that you have them available when you need them
- get a driver's license/ID (I'd suggest a driver's license -- but remember if you've taken this long to get your license, you're only going to get your 9-years-of-driving-experience discount when you're 27)
- not an obligation unless you're traveling internationally, but look into and plan for getting a passport.  It's a proof of identity and citizenship that is better than just about any other.
- Learn how taxation works in your state and in US, and figure out how you fit into it.  You want to learn, at the minimum, how an employee pays taxes, how a business owner pays taxes, how someone who is self-employed pays taxes, and what kinds of non-employee income exist and have taxes paid on them.

Financial obligations:

- figure out what your insurance situations (including health insurance) look like, and how long you're going to be able to keep them
- figure out what your assets are, including any possible savings bonds purchased for you when you were a kid, any college savings accounts, any trusts set up for any inheritance you might have been left by anyone, anything your parents/grandparents saved for you to be able to use for one purpose or another
- figure out how long you have ""room and board"" from your parents, including how long you have that available and/or how long you have before you have to start contributing to it
- Get a credit union or (if no credit unions are available) bank account as soon as you can (make sure it's an account that doesn't have fees, because your earning capacity right now probably isn't high enough to be able to afford those fees)
- learn about what kinds of savings and investments are available to you.  You want to start a 401(k) or Individual Retirement Account (either classic or Roth) as soon as you can.
- Find a source of income (for almost everyone, this is a job of some kind), figure out how much you should be paying for various things (1/3 to shelter and utilities, at least 1/10th to your accessible savings [but save as much as you can], at least 1/10th to your retirement account [which is not the same thing as your accessible savings], some amount that depends on your area's cost of living for food, and the rest to clothes/car/insurance/etc), and keep a set of account books that works also as a budget for these things.  Spend frugally and thriftily.  Any amount from your general fund that you don't spend, move over to your accessible savings.
- Not an obligation, but extremely helpful: learn double-entry bookkeeping.
- Not an obligation, but extremely helpful: learn about tax credits and deductions available to those who fulfill certain tasks (for example, the Lifetime Learning Credit, the American Opportunity Credit, and the Tuition and Fees Deduction, which are available for people who pay certain expenses for students of higher education).

Social obligations:

- Register to vote
- Attend your local city/town/parish council meetings (most people don't view this as an obligation, and I don't know why they don't feel obliged to keep watch over how their towns do business)
- Start keeping a journal of favors others have done for you, and favors you have done for others.  When others do favors for you, you do owe those favors back to them [or, possibly, you owe those favors forward to others].  This is most important if you want to get a job in politics, but participation in any political environment including corporate will benefit from this.
- Keep track of your friends, and keep in touch with them in some manner.  Keep in touch with people you owe favors to, and people who owe favors to you, as well.
- Keep a calendar.  Budget your time.  When you're young, it doesn't matter much if you blow your time budget -- but college is one of those things where you will either learn how to keep your time budget or you'll be crushed.  Your professional life will need it even more.
- Not an obligation, but you should get a library card, and make liberal use of it.  Most libraries have access to books, e-books, audiobooks, magazines, newspapers... and also host events for their patrons.

Food/Shelter plans:

- figure out how long your parents are going to allow you to stay under their roof, and how much they're going to charge you to do so
- figure out how long you want to stay under your parents' roof
- figure out what kind of place you'd want to move to (there's an app put out by the US Census Department, called ""dwellr"", which could help with this -- but it's by no means the only source of information), and research jobs, opportunities, costs of rental and land ownership, the legal and social climates, cost of living, to figure out if there is any place you might be willing to move to.
- if you don't move out of your area, you'll still need to figure out what housing is available in your area, and how much it would cost to move out of your parents' place
- figure out how you're going to pay for the move and ongoing costs associated with where you're going to move

Future plans:

- Figure out what problems exist in the world that you want to solve and/or what else you want to do with your life
- Figure out what kind of training you need to get to where you can do what you want to do with your life
- Figure out the stepping stones to getting that training (which usually include at least some measure of 'college', or at least trade school)
- figure out how you're going to achieve that training, including transportation to it, the tools necessary for your trade, and paying for it

Social obligations:

- You're during the last period of time you're expected to be irresponsible, but at this point anything that you do that's too irresponsible or illegal is going to be charged to you and go on your Permanent (arrest and/or criminal) record
- Have fun with your friends, but start setting aside time to work on your goals (including planning for those goals)
- Find things that don't involve carousing to do, that you consider to be fun.  You want at least one or two things you can do on your own, preferably at least one of them associated with your goals; you also want at least one or two things that you can do with friends.  Learn how to budget your time between them, and also include ""rest"" in your time budget.
- Figure out how you're going to exercise and get to the gym.

There's a lot in here that I have screwed up and failed to do, and now I'm kicking myself for not having done them.

No, you don't need 1 million to live in Van. You need 1 million to have a house in Van and live comfortably.

TheRedPill,4,0,4,"This is why I detest the discussion around racism and privilege.

By focussing on differences between what people experience, we are essentially hindering the expansion of the in-group. 

Humans are limited by biology. There will always be the concept of the in-group and the out-group--there's no way to get around that. So the best strategy toward acceptance and tolerance of other races or cultures is to concentrate on what makes us similar. Behaviors and experiences and tendencies that are universal. That is, expand the in-group to encompass more and more people.

Focussing on ""invisible knapsacks"" and the differences in what people experience and all that only reinforces divisions between groups.

What is most frustrating to me regarding the idea of ""white guilt"" is that it was whites who first expanded their concept of the in-group to include blacks. It was Britain and other white cultures, including the US, who, for the first time in history said, ""wait a minute, these are human beings. Slavery is kinda wrong, yo"". 

As such, they seem to be the people held most responsible for it. Blacks in Mauritania who still practice slavery? Meh. Brown people in Qatar who still practice slavery? Meh. It's all the fault of whites, because whites were the first to realize, from the position of owners rather than slaves, that it was morally not okay. 

By taking the high road, they make themselves vulnerable to criticism. Why didn't you end it sooner? Why did you do it in the first place? You bastards!

As far as whites being more sympathetic to blacks than whites, that's an explicit attitude, not an implicit one. ",t3_36rx42,crjiako,t1_crjdrvz,t1_crjiako

Why do so many people in developing countries die of disease and starvation? If the people with the automation resources don't need you because you have nothing to offer then you're going to have a bad time. This is basically true today at the bottom of society in the US but once 50% of the population have no value to offer from their labour it'll become more obvious.

Member #1 told member #2 about this and made a plan to go along with it and then rob this kid instead.

imaginarymaps,-10,0,-10,"I'm not denying the of some of them existed there for well over a millennia, but most Palestinians trace their ancestry to Egypt or Syria, having migrated there once the jews made the land more hospitable and led to an economic boom. 

Previously the carrying capacity of the land was very low, and it was mostly a desolate wasteland of deserts and swamps with high mortality from nile fever and malaria. The jews drained the swamps and reforested the overgrazed hills ( mostly the work of the Jewish National Fund). 

Nor was palestinian nationalism an identity until less than a century ago, they just saw themselves (and a large portion still though) as arabs, muslims, with their strongest alliance to their local clan. 

The Palestinian identity was invented as a counter to zionism. It would be similar to inventing a new 'east kansas' national identity or something similar. Sure, now it is an established nationality, but people seem to assume it was the case during the crucial years of this conflict, which simply wasn't the case.",t3_373owc,crjnx9k,t1_crjknpf,t1_crjnx9k

He lived at the same address as on the 1920 Census, which indicates his parents were born in Ireland: that and the WWI DRC data suggest his parents were Henry and Jane, who were in Philly by [1880](https://familysearch.org/search/record/results?count=20&amp;query=%2Bgivenname%3Athomas~%20%2Bsurname%3Astinson~%20%2Bbirth_place%3Apennsylvania~%20%2Bbirth_year%3A1876-1881~). Checking for Richard (as he's called in the 1880 Census) reveals he was still in Philadelphia in 1940, and that his wife was named Monica, not Minerva.

The death certificate for Richard T. Stinson shows he was born July 20, 1877 (same date as Thomas Richard Stinson of the WWI DRC) in Philadelphia, son of Henry Stinson and an unknown mother. The informant was Monica Stinson, who lived with him. T. R. Stinson was buried at Holy Sepulchre.

Monica Stinson was born 31 May 1887 England, and died July 1970. The 1930 Census indicates she was married at the age of 21, giving an approximate marriage year of 1908. A Richard T. Stinson married a Miss Faulkner in Philadelphia in 1908. 

The 1930 Census gives her year of immigration as 1904. A Monica Faulkner, aged 17,  of Irish descent, came from Lancashire, England, to Philadelphia in [August 1904](https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-1942-21581-21442-17?cc=1921481). She was going to meet an uncle there. The birth of a  Mary Monica Faulkner was recorded in the Leigh district of Lancashire in [summer 1887](https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2X5V-ZMT).

StateOfDecay,4,0,4,"[Check out SwissArmyKnife's YOSE mods](https://forums.undeadlabs.com/threads/swissarmyknifes-yose-mods-collection.48433/).

I know if you download his ""Military Operations on Urban Terrain Interrupted"", it has a variety of options you can choose to add in, including multiple specializations/special techniques. He also has a variety of other mods that people like.

The improved base mod creator looks like they have not updated (the old one can work, but it wouldn't have ammo manufacturing in it or snack creation), but I know the QMJS Extended Functions Mods tweeks the facilities and allows companions to shoot.

LetsNotMeet,3,0,3,"I wasn't even aware of the Original Night Stalker's area of operations until now.  Just looked at a dedicated website on him, and now I know he carried out a lot of attacks within just a couple miles of where I have family right now, and some of them well under a mile away.  Not cool at all.

It is consolation to know this all happened decades ago, long before my family members moved into that area.  It would have frightened me to no end having them so close to a hot spot of a very active rapist and later serial killer.

He seems to have been scary as hell in the way he did things, too.  Burglary activity of the neighbors and maybe of the victim before the actual attack.  Hang up calls to the victim or neighbors of the victim before and after the attack.  Especially if this sort of thing began happening to my family members, I would beg them to come stay with me for a while.  Then if he came to my place I'd at least have a chance to shoot him and end that crap.

What's really unnerving is that, by witness accounts, he must have been a baby boomer.  Unless he was arrested or killed, he is very likely still alive.  Kind of like BTK, another very scary individual, gone dormant but still alive, still waiting and planning.  Thankfully BTK was caught, but this dude never was.  One idea floated on one of the websites was that he has left the country to keep raping and killing where technology is less able to help catch him.

* Your main character is passive, he is an observer. The story is really about the girl, do you really need him? If so, then he should have something to do with the story. The change should affect him in some way. The girl is a friend or a sister or something like that. 
* Try to not use spoken words when not neccesary, as for example your first line. Just have a sound and the beautiful thing of cinema is that the audience will think ""what is that sound? when there is a weird offscreen sound"". 
* Try to avoid describing characters' feelings or judgements that characters make. Feelings are not visible, so if you want to bring across feelings in a film you need to show them, which for a screenplay means describing what is seen and heard that reflects the feelings.

exmuslim,1,0,1,"&gt;is a huge deterrent and completely fine

LOL. Yeah, no shit it's a huge deterrent. Why not prescribe death for it, it's an even BIGGER deterrent you know? Maybe Saudi would do even better if they did that. 

As for lashes, if it's something harmless like that, why is it even a punishment? Can you explain that?

Second, do you seriously believe it always happens like that? I suppose you would, since you live in the West and don't know anything about actual life in a Muslim country. 

But then, even if the lashes were super harsh, you'd still be for it right? You have no choice in the matter after all, it's in your religion. 

&gt;mainly because it's working.

No, it isn't actually. It has yet to create a functioning society in the Middle East.

And is it any wonder why? You threaten people with death and whipping, so they obey. What a functional society you have right there. I'm sure no problems come from this at all, it's why the Middle East has been leading the world in culture and science and art. 

&gt;domestic violence, crimes of passion

These both happen in large numbers in the Muslim world. Domestic violence against your wife is actually condoned, though you probably lie to yourself about that as well.

&gt;are you also against the use of violence against criminals?

Yes, kiddo. Ever heard of Scandinavia? The place your Jihadi and Neo-Nazi friends love shitting on? Clearly their system of rehab is better than stoning and whipping people like a bunch of iron age monkey's. 

&gt;when I'll literally use them on my public website

I can't remember where I read it, perhaps on here somewhere, but some people claim js is a good introductory language.

I don't disagree with you though, Python is a great choice.

but honestly it is my opinion that the best and most important thing is internalization. the desire to stop, or start for that matter, any behavior must come from within or it will never be genuine and thus never last. the aids like this subreddit and accountabuddies are there to help but no amount of those things can help us if we do not want it for ourselves. i am not implying that this is not the case in your situation. i am simply expressing my view that without an internalization progress will be disingenuous at best.

today marks the beginning of my 120 day reboot. i want to be a better person than i am currently and this is one of the things that i dislike about myself. i will abstain from PMO for this period. the struggle will be real but must be had. and by the sounds of those that survived it, worthwhile.

They even charge for removal services without giving any guarantee.

Second option is to push down negative links on search results with web content that shows your reputation in a positive light. Here are few basic points recommend by ORM experts to push down negative links.
1. You can create relevant blogs and update them on regular basis.
2. List your business on high authority domain websites .
3. Create strong business profiles on websites like cruchbase,vator and lot more.

I think we have conflicting views on morality. Sure, in the past, empires have been founded on bones and blood, and of course all great civilizations have had to conquer and kill to grow.

Now it's been a couple years and it's all forgiven and Palestinians should just forget about it? How can you possibly tell me to just give up? The homeowners are not Israeli's, they are Palestinian. 


&gt;I think a better solution would be more work on both sides to have the Palestinians be legally assimilated into citizens of Israel, and have contentious regions like Gaza to be absorbed into Israel's domain.

DeadBedrooms,2,0,2,"If that's the case, you may want to look up [Personality disorders](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/personality-disorders/basics/symptoms/con-20030111)... some of this may resonate with you... especially the Cluster B materials...

&gt; Types of personality disorders are grouped into three clusters, based on similar characteristics and symptoms. Many people with one personality disorder also have signs and symptoms of at least one additional personality disorder.

&gt; **Cluster B personality disorders**

&gt; Cluster B personality disorders are characterized by dramatic, overly emotional or unpredictable thinking or behavior. They include antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder. It's not necessary to exhibit all the signs and symptoms listed for a disorder to be diagnosed.

&gt; **Antisocial personality disorder:**
* Disregard for others' needs or feelings
* Persistent lying, stealing, using aliases, conning others
* Recurring problems with the law
* Repeated violation of the rights of others
* Aggressive, often violent behavior
* Disregard for the safety of self or others
* Impulsive behavior
* Consistently irresponsible
* Lack of remorse for behavior

&gt; **Borderline personality disorder:**
* Impulsive and risky behavior, such as having unsafe sex, gambling or binge eating
* Unstable or fragile self-image
* Unstable and intense relationships
* Up and down moods, often as a reaction to interpersonal stress
* Suicidal behavior or threats of self-injury
* Intense fear of being alone or abandoned
* Ongoing feelings of emptiness
* Frequent, intense displays of anger
* Stress-related paranoia that comes and goes

&gt; **Histrionic personality disorder:**
* Constantly seeking attention
* Excessively emotional, dramatic or sexually provocative to gain attention
* Speaks dramatically with strong opinions, but few facts or details to back them up
* Easily influenced by others
* Shallow, rapidly changing emotions
* Excessive concern with physical appearance
* Thinks relationships with others are closer than they really are

&gt; **Narcissistic personality disorder:**
* Belief that you're special and more important than others
* Fantasies about power, success and attractiveness
* Failure to recognize others' needs and feelings
* Exaggeration of achievements or talents
* Expectation of constant praise and admiration
* Arrogance
* Unreasonable expectations of favors and advantages, often taking advantage of others
* Envy of others or belief that others envy you",t3_37a29y,crlekdu,t1_crl0bvz,t1_crlekdu

AskReddit,1,0,1,"Disclaimer: I'm not a photographer, but I did major in it.

By and large, I think just about everyone will focus on your portfolio, rather than whether or not you have a degree.

With that said, I've heard that weddings/portraits are basically the *only* way to make a living doing photography.

There's also advertising, journalism, and art, but it would take a long time before you actually got a steady income.

The technical aspects of photography can be self-taught or learned at meetups or community college courses. The reason to major in it at a university is that you really get into nitty-gritty debates with your lecturers about concepts, what your images mean, and how effective you are at conveying that. A pretty image is one thing, but your images have to have purpose.

In addition to that, you'd likely get access to a photo studio, and maybe a chance to tinker with medium- and large-format cameras. I think very few schools teach film anymore.

Since digital became big, the market has become completely oversaturated with photographers, so I'd advise against majoring in it. I graduated a while ago and haven't touched an SLR camera since. I did learn a lot about what makes a good and bad image, but I think I could've spent all that time and money studying something more practical.

Some of my classmates, however, went on to work in ad agencies, so perhaps I just lacked the talent/passion to make anything out of my degree.

As for your photos, they're pretty good considering you're 15, but please keep practicing. It takes like 5-10 years before you actually get good at something (writing, singing, dancing, whatever). Movies have us believe that people are born with a talent, but the truth is that people are born good at something but still have to spend a long time developing that skill before they can do anything worthwhile with it. The trick is knowing what you're good at and loving it enough to not care about the obstacles.

BasicIncome,21,0,21,"&gt;I have heard, though, that some former colleagues who are in salaried full-time non-managerial positions and work more than 40 hours don't think they qualify for overtime. I'm not sure if it's in their checks and they're not noticing it or something, but it's my understanding that they do qualify for overtime even as salaried employees. For some reason there's this widespread misconception that salaried employees don't deserve overtime, which doesn't seem explicitly covered in the article above, but that would be another form of wage theft.

This is one of the biggest wage myths and practically everyone believes it. But it's much harder to prove because you don't clock in or out of work. 

I've worked quite a few jobs now, and employers putting their employees on salary to avoid paying them overtime has been a thing in every single one of those jobs. No one ever says anything.

Every time I'm offered salary, I outright refuse. I would make less per hour due to the amount of work I'm expected to work vs the amount of hours I'm actually made to work.",t3_37c04y,crlohw1,t1_crlo6jd,t1_crlohw1

If you actually look at his twitter feed right now, it's not filled with childish insults.  It's filled with rational explanations for his actions, and explanations of his views on the situation.  Sure, you can sense some annoyance at points, but who wouldn't be a little annoyed with thousands of people coming down on you as hard as the twittersphere seems to be.  

As to what he's done in the past in terms of arguing with people on reddit and whatnot; from what I understand, that was some time ago.  I really don't like the idea that we are all beholden to the mistakes of our past.  Making mistakes in the past shouldn't have such a huge bearing on how one is viewed in the present day.  I've lashed out at people in the past: I used to have huge anger issues.  But slowly I've fixed that; I'm not that person anymore.  People change: you have, I have, Richard Lewis has.  He's not the same ball of hatred he was in the past, and I feel like it's unfair to brand him as such just because of things he did or said some time ago.  

I guess what I'm saying is cut the guy some slack.  He might be a little quick tempered even now, but I see a marked improvement in his actions compared to a year ago.

Look at Math, Music, Humor, Love. Order and predictability in a universe supposedly made from chaos. Beauty and Joy and Creativity in a world made from a random pattern of mistakes? No.  
  
Look at Woman. Tenderness and emotional complexity in a form so beautiful you cannot deny she is God's final creation, his fantastic climax to a universe so complex and incredible that it practically screams his name, his signature on a masterpiece to end all masterpieces.  
  
Look at yourself. Made in the image of The Father, your soul given the unique power to LOVE, to seek Him, to seek truth. Your heart given the drive to conquer, subdue, and discover, and explore His creation.  
  
Look at all these things. And know that they are His.  
  
And above all, Know that He loves you beyond all that is describable.

linux,1,0,1,"&gt; A typical small ARM-style system doesn't have a 'BIOS' or 'EFI' or anything on it. When you 'turn on' the system then voltage is applied to the 'SoC' and the processor immediately begins executing any code that may exist at address 0x0 (or 0x8000 or whatever it is for that particular processor).

opiates,2,0,2,"**Any opiate naive person should definitely read this part I found in the comment section on the site. Just feel obligated to post this response to the blog too**

AWK responds in a very interesting perspective that I definitely can sympathize with, however I do think he should leave some delicate warning for anyone with this question.. or anyone who haven't done hardcore opiates in general. It is all there but subtle, and this a pretty interesting response from a commenter. 

&gt;It’s brave to not go the route of “just please, don’t do it,” but please, anyone considering that path, don’t do it. You may feel like you’re feeling better, you’re escaping the misery that is life and its hopelessness, but it’s just tricking your brain into thinking things are better. And if you think you feel bad now? Just wait until it leaves your system. It’s a one-way ticket to disease, more poverty, even death. Even if you get clean you can destroy the parts of your brain that are responsible for any “feel-good” chemicals in the first place, leaving you a shell of the person you used to be. If you’re an addict and you’re struggling with opiate dependence, there are medications like buprenorphine or buprenorphine/naloxone that are definitely worth trying. Some critics say it’s just replacing one drug with another, but there’s definitely a big difference between taking a needle 5 times a day and taking 2mg of buprenorphine one time a day, and just long enough to get you on your feet. With any luck you’ll find a doctor who prescribes it responsibly (requiring drug tests, counseling, and does not require a cash-only payment) And if you don’t like the idea of taking a medication, just remember: there are people who are on powerful antidepressants their entire lives to deal with their mental disease and that’s what addiction is: a mental disease. There are doctors, lawyers, nurses, EMTs, all walks of life who go to a clinic with me. I have pain due to permanent nerve damage and I take subutex every day and this was after becoming dependent on painkillers from numerous surgeries at just the age of 24. I thankfully decided to seek help before it was too late and I’ve seen firsthand what it’s done for people who were even on the hardest drugs available and I have not seen a single person whose life hasn’t been completely changed. They feel the same hardships as everyone else, but now have the courage to deal with daily life without drugs.

&gt;I know this sounds like an advertisement, but the people in my group don’t have to think about sobriety every day. They just get to live like normal people and I wish more people knew about it and knew that it’s not the dangerous drug everyone thinks it is. Most people just know about it when they hear about someone on the street taking 16x the normal amount to get high, but it’s definitely safer (and better regulated) than methadone and insurance covers it in many cases. It can save your life! Thank you.

This is not the same route everyone takes, however I feel obligated to let any opiate naive individual (who has not gone past hydrocodones) know that stepping into hardcore opiates will most likely cause a drastic change in your lifestyle.

Seattle,1,0,1,"Sounds like it's time for growers to go underground again and just continue to supply the black market.  It's what we had to do in So.Cal.  The MMJ shops would ask you $2,200lb whole sale then turn it and burn it for $8,000.  

I'm not sure they actually asked anyone with actual experience in other states how this long game plays out.

If they keep jacking up the prices for REC then home growing is going to explode.  Thus you got some fancy neighborhood reeking like skunk.  They call the cops then the fight is on.  Your best weed growers in so.cal are tucked away in the richest neighborhoods, or on a surfing beach somewhere where the majority community is involved.  I've grown weed next to people you see on TV everyday with talk shows.  The market will adapt and do the same thing to Seattle.

I had drug dogs walk my house in So Cal, got raided, etc.  

Always got off without a warning, because prop 215 and prop 420 are legit and protect the patient.  

I can pull 4lbs from a spare bed room every 60 days, and distribute that out to the black market and make twice the return is that what they want?  Thought they wanted people to want to pay them taxes?  

I thought the whole idea for legal weed was to make it legal for everyone over 21.  Colorado is down to $6 grams, Michigan has been flirting with $6 grams, and Nor Cal in 5 months you will see it rain from the sky.  You got BC bud up north, Oregon getting ready to go online with legal weed, and Colorado selling so much the state can't stock it.  They are driving to So. Cal and buying $100,000 at a time.  

I can show you 3 rec shops right now that won't even sell you a 1/4 in Seattle.  They sell by gram or 1/8th at the most.  At $20 - $35 gram that's not even close to medical strength.  This is backwards logic.  And 100% worse prices than when it wasn't legal.

Washington is trying to do everything wrong.  I've already explained a medical patient when converted to rec prices will be looking at $38,000 a year in weed not including transportation where some will now have to drive 100+ miles each way.",t3_37f5bn,crmqnya,t3_37f5bn,t1_crmqnya

My point is rather: the new rules formulation confuses some people, and make them believe rogue builds are verbotten.

I suggest updating the rule 2 to clarify your point.",t3_37gwcx,crmszxv,t1_crmrfzz,t1_crmszxv

tifu,7,0,7,"Well, this is kinda technical so pay attention:

Chrome saves the your most visited sites in a interesting new way, so we'll hack it apart a bit to tweak it.

Step1:  [Download SQL Lite.](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)

Step2:  Put the EXE --sqllite.exe-- in 
    
    (windows) 
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\
    (mac) 
    ~/library/application support/google/chrome/default
    (ubuntu)
    /home/&lt;user&gt;/.config/google-chrome/default


Step3: Open sqllite.exe and type:

    .open ""Top Sites""

This will open the file named Top Sites.

    .tables
This lists the tables in this SQLLite database.  You should see ""meta             thumbnails"".  Thumbnails is the table we're after.

    .schema ""thumbnails""
Now we see the CREATE TABLE statement used to create the table...  I see a URL as my primary key.  That's what we'll delete by.


    select * from thumbnails;
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE SEMICOLON!  It selects all the rows from the table ""thumbnails"".

Poke around in the output (make your command window bigger if you have to), and find the offending top site entry.  Then you will:

    delete from thumbnails where url = ""http://www.idunfuckedupandhaveaweirdpiconmyscreen.com/YeaYou/Dun/Fucked/Up"";

Re-run the select statement to make sure you deleted the offending thumbnail, and you're all set!  

This is the quick and dirty, you could also just nuke the thumbnail column by setting it to NULL and have it overwrite to a new thumbnail, but I assume you want to remove the entire entry.

Enjoy!

gifs,1,0,1,"Okay.  And the notion that history can be used as a weapon is valid as well. Do you see?  The actual use of a generalization can inhibit progress based on interests who would have it so.  Which is to say that the culture of male-dominance may be prolonged simply by reverting to a historical perspective on the matter.  

And even within the generalization, there is a lot of grey area.  For example, in reference to pioneer and early American settlers (a male dominated culture), Zinn wrote:

""Societies based on private property and competition, in which monogamous families became practical units for work and socialization, found it especially useful to establish this special status of women, something akin to a house slave in the matter of intimacy and oppression, and yet requiring, because of that intimacy, and long-term connection with children, a special patronization, which on occasion, especially in the face of a show of strength, could slip over into treatment as an equal.""

So this means even in such societies, there might be something else going on behind closed doors.  I know a lot of women who are traditional and more conservative; they think the man should be the head of the household, be the bread winner, be the authoritarian with the kids, etc.  But I guarantee you that if their husband smacked them the way the man in this video did to his wife, they would have probably knocked his ass out, and their brothers and fathers would have pummeled the body on the floor.  So there are *degrees* of acceptable male dominance per society.  This is not a uniform condition.  

And as Zinn points out, even early American women often had equal status behind closed doors.  And this is supposed to be a ""male dominated"" society.  

Furthermore, he wrote:

""In the Zuni tribes of the Southwest, for instance, extended families- large clans-were based on the woman, whose husband came to live with her family. It was assumed that women owned the houses, and the fields belonged to the clans, and the women had equal rights to what was produced. A woman was more secure, because she was with her own family, and she could divorce the man when she wanted to, keeping their property.""

So there's apparently a lot of this going on in Africa as well.  

It's easy to accidentally think that a globally dominant sort of culture, like Arab Muslim, or White Anglo-Christian, represents a large number of the cultures, simply because they are so big today.  But the fact is that despite their success, they are only a few of *many* cultures which have existed, and do exist today.  And since the winners write history, obviously their version is what we have - at least as a mainstream reference.

ffxi,1,0,1,"1) Those subs just about cover it.  I'm mostly /RUN or /WAR these days, but I have a dualbox for sneak/invis (a great perk to staying as /DNC) as well as heals.  /nin is necessary for certain endgame fights (like pretty much every AA) and /run is useful in any magic heavy fight, like any delve.  /war is going to be your max DD sub, and /sam is really just a gimmick sub, it can be fun to try it out, but don't expect to play it often unless you simply want to.

2) Rudra's above 2k TP (1750 with Moonshade TP bonus) is going to be the best bang for your buck.  I evisceration spam when CPing though for the most part.

3) Most people will tell you Vajra, I can't agree or disagree, the spreadsheet says Vajra, but spreadsheets are about ideal circumstance, not actual combat.  However, actual combat should even favor Vajra more, most likely.  But Mandau is pretty cheap and still much easier than Vajra these days.

4) I usually use Razed Ruins and Apocalypse and then a strong Regen atma.  Might be better for some fights to switch one of those DD ones to another regen atma, though.

PurplePillDebate,2,0,2,"&gt;Emotions won't be a perfect guide to reality--they won't necessarily tell you what to do in a situation. But they will give you data and information about situations and about yourself

No one is arguing they are a perfect guide and while they provide data, their fallibility means they are a vulnerability and thus a weakness. And they are extremely fallible which means their data is often inaccurate.

&gt;What you do with it is up to you but a person who feels an emotion is not primed to be less rational in every case.

The more intense the emotions, the higher the chance of flaws in reasoning, logic and decision making. Further, the harder it is to keep focus and control of one's body. So yes, we are primed to be less rational the more emotional we are. For low intensity emotions, the influence may be insignificant.

&gt;A person who doesn't feel emotions would be someone who doesn't have access to some of the data our unconscious mind is processing for us. 

Losing data from an unreliable and unverifiable source isn't a bad thing. In fact, without the potentially false data factoring into decisions, one might do much better with only the more reliable data. Computers operate without emotion and Artificial Intelligence researches and computer programmers are taking bigger steps every day by replacing human decision making with superior computer decision making.

&gt;Letting your emotions drive your judgement would be very unwise--but trying not to feel your emotions is equally unwise. 

I do not believe that is true. In a lot of circumstances, repressing one's emotions allows for better decision making, especially under stressful situations, a wider range of possible actions and greater success in most fields. Being unemotional allows one to continue to function well, accomplish goals, plan for the future, work and contribute to society. Being extremely emotional makes one impulsive, prone to conflict, unreliable, incapable of future planning, dangerous to others and quite feral. The two, in my view, are not equally weighted. 

&gt;You wouldn't use an emotion in science but without excitement of discovery, curiosity, etc. many people would lack the motivation to do science. It's hard work--emotions are also motivators, rewards, information, etc.

Yes, emotion does provide a significant portion of our motivation and drive because, as I said, that's what emotions do, they provoke action. 

But none of that disputes the reality that our emotions are severe vulnerabilities(even if they do have some strengths) and are therefore an overall weakness.

news,1,0,1,"let me break down how wrong and retarded you are, even-though its a waste of time.

&gt;report envisions the terror group as a U.S. strategic asset.

First off, using shit sources and propaganda sites like levantreport lowers your credibility massively. Like what they say about that intelligence document, which i've read, is not what they claim it is saying. How about you read the source material instead of listing bullshit websites that lie, take shit out of context, and other nonsense; which this site did to a low level briefing about 'whats going on.' 

The guy who went on to help form IS started his terrorist group in 1999, IS was born out of the Shura council, which was multiple radical groups. Who Assad supported during the Iraq war against the US.

&gt;ISI hopes to install Gulbadin Hekmatyar contingent on defeating the Najibullah government. Hekmatyar also acquires millions of dollars in additional funding from Osama bin Laden, thus placing ISI, CIA and bin Laden in joint venture.

That's your evidence? That the ISI got money from bin laden therefore the US supported Bin laden? your evidence doesn't prove anything. 

So in short, when you don't know what you are talking about and make outrageous claims, then post evidence that not only is a lie, but more that doesn't support what you are saying. Please stop, you are wrong.

 [**Horseshoe theory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe%20theory): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;The __horseshoe theory__ in [political science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science) asserts that rather than the [far left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_left) and the [far right](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_right) being at opposite and opposing ends of a [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear) political [continuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_(theory\)), they in fact closely resemble one another, much like the ends of a [horseshoe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe). The theory is attributed to French writer [Jean-Pierre Faye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Faye). 

&gt;In [University of Reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Reading) academic Peter Barker's  book, *GDR and Its History*, Peter Thompson  of the [University of Sheffield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sheffield) observes that the theory is ""increasingly orthodox,"" and describes the theory as seeing ""left and right-wing parties being closer to each other than the centre.""

rocketbeans,1,0,1,"Interessante Beobachtungen und da alles Gesehene im Film immer das Ergebnis von Entscheidung ist, wären solche Bezüge gar nicht unrealistisch.

Die religiösen Motive würde ich aber nicht so in den Mittelpunkt rücken. Bei deiner Deutung mischt du auch sehr stark zwischen den Religionen und wenn der Regisseur etwas Religiöses ausdrücken will, dann könnte er das nur erreichen, wenn er sich auf eine Religion konzentriert. Hier hätte er sich dann sicherlich nur auf die muslimischen Symbole bezogen.

Die geerbte Religion gehört einfach zur Lebensrealität der Charaktere, aber ich sehe nicht, dass jemand seine Handlungen darauf bezieht oder im Zwiespalt steht. Man kann darin aber sicher einen Bezug zu den inspirierenden amerikanischen Gangsterfilmen sehen, bei denen die religiösen Motive allerdings inhaltlich tatsächlich eine sehr starke Rolle spielen. Was du als Gebetshaltung bezeichnest, wäre ja auch eine christliche Geste, aber letztlich falten viele Leute die Hände so, wenn sie nachdenken. Entscheidender dürfte in dem Moment der Bildaufbau sein, damit man die Hände sieht.

Ein starkes Symbol ist aber sicherlich, dass Tibet Isa im Waschraum der Moschee ersticht. Meiner Meinung nach steht das aber gerade dafür, dass Tibet so sehr von seiner Wut überwältigt ist, dass er seine Außenwelt gar nicht mehr wahrnimmt und nicht mal dieser Ort ihn davon abbringt. In dem Moment schließt er mit allen weltlichen und geistlichen Dingen ab.

Natürlich muss sich ein Autor auch für Namen entscheiden und es ist nicht unüblich, dass man das irgendwie begründet, aber auch da würde ich nicht zu viel reininterpretieren. Was ist mit den anderen Namen? Curly, Brownie, Scholle und letztlich auch Chiko? 

Isa und Meryem sind sehr weit verbreitete türkische Namen und ich sehe darin nur den Aufhänger, dass Meryem darin einen Punkt findet, an dem sie eine Verbindung sehen kann. Im Christentum gibt es auch drei unterschiedliche Frauen mit dem Namen Maria. Eine davon ist Maria Magdalena, die man allgemein als geläuterte Hure interpretiert.

Ich habe aber mal nachgesehen, wie das so im Koran sein soll. Dort steht Meryem offenbar tatsächlich nur für die Mutter von Isa. Aber wenn du schon das religiöse Motiv dahinter deuten willst, warum hörst du dann bei dem Aspekt der Jungfräulichkeit auf? Wenn hinter der Namensgebung eine religiöse Aussage stecken soll, dann könnte man den zwangsläufigen Inzest nur schwer ignorieren.

Und wenn es um einen Brudermord im religiösen Sinne geht, was ist dann die Aussage? Im Christentum markiert der Mord an Abel die Erbsünde, an die man im Islam aber nicht glaubt und daher stellt es dort auch nicht den Sündenfall der Menschheit dar (und die Passion Christi gibt es dort auch nicht - also auch keine Vergebung der Erbsünde). Der Mord an Abel spielt also im Islam keine so wesentliche Rolle, wie im Christentum und das gleiche gilt für Isa, der im Islam nur ein Prophet ist.

Ich hatte schon einen eigenen Kommentar geschrieben. Meiner Meinung nach ist der Film auf Authentizität ausgerichtet. Chiko, Tibet und Curly sind ja Spitznamen (bei Tibet vermute ich das nur), die dafür stehen, dass sie die Vorstellung haben, dass das coole Gangsterleben alle ihre Probleme löst. Wenn Chiko seinen künstlichen Namen ablegt, dann weil er die Sinnlosigkeit dieser Idee erkannt hat und sich für die Freundschaft entscheidet.

Ich würde auch sagen, dass Tibet derjenige ist, der am meisten verliert. Chiko dagegen hängt ja anfangs an nichts. Tibet versucht auch nicht Brownie zu bestehlen, um sich zu bereichern, sondern um seiner Mutter eine Niere zu kaufen.

Dann noch zur Kleidung: Dunkle Kleidung und Dreitagebärte sind jetzt nicht so außergewöhnlich. Abgesehen davon trägt Brownie braun und Curly hat bereits in der ersten Szene eine relativ helle Jacke an. Ich hab auch extra noch mal nachgesehen - eigentlich kommen einem viele Sachen nur schwarz vor, weil der Film nachgedunkelt wurde und auch vieles im Dunkeln spielt. Die Laufburschen von Brownie tragen beispielsweise eine dunkelbraune und eine dunkelblaue Jacke. Generell bemüht man sich bei Filmen oft um eine reduzierte Farbpalette, um einen einheitlichen Look und eine Stimmung zu erreichen.


PS.: Am Ende hast du immer Curly statt Brownie geschrieben.

Buddhism,0,0,0,"It's hard to get a complete picture without more details, but I find it very interesting that you have placed blame on yourself in this situation (i.e. 'how to deal with my negative thoughts'; 'I can't help but think it's done on purpose'). 

In every relationship, both partners have needs. Wanting your boyfriend to be affectionate in public-- perhaps it's a lot to ask for him to engage in a full-blown make-out session, yes, but making eye contact, holding your hand, showing you in any small way that he cares or ACKNOWLEDGES your presence is not an irrational request or an irrational desire for a relationship.

I can't speak about the plans for your mutual friend's birthday, but I do sense an underlying theme here. It seems like you have some valid issues with the way you are being treated in the relationship, and when you address these issues with your boyfriend (as you should, communication is key in any relationship), he is gaslighting you (a manipulation tactic from an abusive partner to deflect the blame and twist the information to make you feel guilty).

 Example:

You: It really hurts my feelings when you don't acknowledge my presence when we are in a group setting. 

Him: Why do you always have to be so negative? You are so sensitive.

In this example, he is (perhaps subconsciously) assigned the blame to you for why YOU feel this way, making you feel like it is solely your problem, and he is not taking any accountability for his role in things.

Relationships are about compromise, and finding a healthy middle ground where both of you feel like your needs are met. You are valid in any emotion you are having. So is he. But the way we express these feelings is important-- this is where it can become abusive or unhealthy. 

I would approach him again, and gently let him know that there have been issues in your communication that have been bothering you, and you would like to talk to them. If during this conversation he starts shifting the blame to you and deflecting responsibility for his role in the situation, (i.e. why are you so negative?) gently bring the conversation back: Yes, I do have a negative response to this situation, because I feel like my feelings were not taken into consideration. It would make me really happy if you could show a bit more affection in public. It's really important to me. You aren't assigning the blame to anyone, you are simply sharing your feelings.

I have been in this kind of relationship before. If nothing comes from this conversation and there is already a long-standing pattern of you being treated this way, I would encourage you to  consider ending the relationship. These kinds of relationships are really tricky, because over time it can make you feel like you're the guilty party-- and it's your fault that you're not happy, and that there's something wrong with you for having completely valid emotional needs.

PM if you want to talk.

Sorry for the long post!!

pcmasterrace,1,0,1,"&gt; but their linux drivers suck balls and their answer is to release an open source driverand let linux guys do the work?

I don't think you understand what I was saying. AMD support their own driver with their own developers. The main contributors for the open source AMD drivers are AMD employees. And the new driver that they are releasing is an entirely fresh codebase which was all fresh code from AMD themselves. They aren't pawning it off, in fact they hired more people and doubled down. 

&gt; I get that nvidia has done some shadey uncompetitive stuff but the is shit that AMD seems to completely ignore and doesn't understand why nvidia is so far ahead and one of the main reasons is the CUDA and linux support.

AMD's closed driver has full OpenCL support. CUDA isn't the reason why Nvidia was ahead on Linux. It was more that Nvidia just had more developers on their driver. Now its about even but AMD are playing catch up. CUDA is a non-issue. 

&gt; In bioinformatics all themachines are linux based and all use nvidia cards because it relatively plug and play. These aren't little cards either we are talking 970s/980s. In tri/quad sli setups as well, we simply need the computational power.

What? This isn't really an issue at all. 

&gt; The margin companies can make on the top end cards are huge, nvidia has admitted the guys that buy the top end cards are the guys funding the mid range cards r&amp;d.

AMD are trying but they are trying to compete with a company that is twice the size, who already has a massive reputation for putting out good cards and has good quality drivers. AMD had a shitty driver on both platforms up to now but they are trying. ",t3_37janh,crnptvt,t1_crnp8t0,t1_crnptvt

Even then, certain decks are constantly swapping tech cards based on certain metas; you could perhaps substitute Boom with one of those?

nba,2,0,2,"&gt; Why is the default assumption that the NBA is different. 

Because sports in general, and NBA head coaching, is different from other industries? Why is the default assumption that an industry with vast differences from most other corporate industries would have the same practices as those industries?

You're really stuck on the idea that anybody who works at a corporation is escorted out when they're fired. I don't have any statistics, but my feeling is that it's not quite as common as you think it is. I think it happens, even frequently, but I don't think it happens to the extent that you could never, ever be surprised by it happening in a specific situation. But it's irrelevant to me, because the NBA constantly has stories over nothing. I think if this were to have happened before, we would have heard about it. You're obviously free to disagree with me on that point.

&gt; Lastly, reporting on the minutiae of a firing isn't common practice in professional sports or any other industry.

Saying something like ""women are averagely a few IQ points below men"" (just a hypothetical), tends to cause a lot of upset even though it's completely meaningless for an individual woman or man. We must all learn to distance our ego from discussions about demographics. 

&gt;Men and women are equally human beings

This is largely undisputed (even though feminists accuse men of viewing women as less).

&gt;deserve equal human rights as a result

that's how it *should* be at least. And, despite the previous point, it's not how things actually are. 

&gt;and have equal potential. 

potential for what? Some of the differences make some things impossible for one sex and other things effectively impossible and yet other things much much harder. I don't think we can universally say they the sexes have equal potential.

my anxiety/depression had manifested into physical symptoms and my neck was so tense it needed to be cracked around every 2 minutes and it was extremely distracting and noticeable. i was too afraid to tell my mom i wanted to go to a psych, so i went to the pediatrician for this issue. she basically told me i was stressed and to do yoga. when i broke down crying in the appointment, my mom said the next step was to go to a psych.

it was the most relieving feeling in the world. after telling the doctor everything he looks up at me and says, you are severely depressed and anxious. the validation was everything to me. he called my mom in to ask her a few questions and they got me started on meds.

Are we on the same page when it comes to what metaphor is? Metaphors are a figure of speech in which an expression is used to refer to something that it does not literally denote in order to suggest a similarity.

So what precisely is God referring to if the whole of Genesis is metaphorical?

MensRights,4,0,4,"&gt; notice she is only advocating for change in an issue that effects her, she is not campaigning for us all to redistribute wealth each generation to the worlds poor since that would affect her for the worse.

Exactly. Feminism is about redistributing wealth and power such that it all flows to the feminists themselves.

&gt; also her concert stage example is complete bullshit there is no enforced rule that men are at the front they are either their on merit (paid for it) or through choice, any woman can go to the front by the same rule (nothing prevents them based on their gender)

The front and the back of the concert hall is in reference to a recent Muslim gathering in which the men were asked to sit at the front and the women asked to sit at the back.

But moreover, there is a big logical fallacy in her argument. She assumes that just like a concert or movie you can sit at the front one day, at the back another day, and that you get to swap around a lot i.e. there are lots of opportunities to visit the theater and sit down so everyone gets a good view sometimes. In the theater of life that's just plain wrong - there are very few times the doors open up and you may enter, and once you take a seat you will be there for a *long* time. For example, if you get passed over for a promotion due to a feminist quota being in place at your company, it will be an awfully long time until another promotion opportunity turns up again. So what she is really advocating is that men should voluntarily give up their few chances for advancement to let a woman have that advancement instead, and be happy to never be promoted. Which strikes me as incredibly stupid, but that's feminism for you!",t3_37m1of,crojjvk,t1_crnufta,t1_crojjvk

I recommend studying the early Go presentations. In particular

[Go at Google: Language Design in the Service of Software Engineering](https://talks.golang.org/2012/splash.article) [Video also available](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Go-Google)

And the [Original Nov 2009 presentation](http://dave.cheney.net/2012/11/18/the-go-programming-language-2009)

You're not alone feeling that way, it's the same from my perspective. In my uni program the share of childfree people seems to be the highest I've ever seen in a sub-demographic and even that makes for only three people I know are totally childfree (all three female, curiously). A good part of the students in my department is career-oriented and determined and that goes out of the window the second someone mentions children, one time even in the same sentence. Does. not. compute....

Look at schools. Why aren't people marching through the streets over property taxes being used to fund schools if they don't have kids? Because they live in a community, and part of that means that you sometimes (without going to extremes) have to sacrifice in one area, to make gains in another.

europe,2,0,2,"&gt;First of all, They have very similar political systems. Both employ a system based on First Past The Post. A system designed to be extremely manipulable (through various means, such as gerrymandering) and antidemocratic. 

So does Canada and they're part of the Commonwealth so that seems a more apt comparison. Oh wait, I guess that wouldn't be good for the UK/US circlejerk. 

&gt; Both countries are also very rightwing.

The UK's very rightwing? 

The one (excluding N. Ireland) with gay marriage? Half the EU doesn't even have that. 

&gt;Not to mention that the UK is practically a lapdog to the US, even more so than other European countries. The UK has barely any sovereignty left. If the NSA (or some other US agency) asks the UK to jump, the UK asks ""how high?"" Both countries are very hostile to freedom and privacy.

As opposed to nearly every EU intelligence agency working with thee NSA. 

Worth noting the US probably offers far more freedoms (certainly freedom of speech) than most (all?) EU members. 

&gt;The UK has barely any sovereignty left. 

Just utter bullshit, /u/Amanoo 

&gt; If the NSA (or some other US agency) asks the UK to jump, the UK asks ""how high?"" Both countries are very hostile to freedom and privacy.

Bullshit again but let's not forget all the EU members who cooperate with the US or the large NSA installation in Germany or how many CIA black sites the EU has. 

Where's an example of the UK jumping for the US? The time it said it **wasn't** going to war with the US in Syria?

The reason I asked how Comcast is trying to block Google Fiber is because I knew the answer. The answer is they are trying to get laws passed to keep their monopoly, which is exactly what I said in my very first post. Get government out of business and monopolies won't last long.

Since you seem to believe I have no intellectual merit, even though I am an economist by education, I will leave this conversation where it's at.

Like I said I'm fine with talking about Israel's human rights violations-and I despise Netanyahu, so it's not like I'm some shill.  

 And criticism of Israel is not written off as ""spurious accusations,"" he's saying accusing Fischer of leaving Israel off the map to protect them is a spurious accusation because there was no data for Israel. It was an accusation against Fischer's integrity that the blog is calling spurious.

askscience,28,0,28,"I'm sure there is a genetic component to myopia, but there's a lot more to it than that. [This](http://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions/myopia.htm) totally reliable source says incidence of myopia jumped from 25% to 42% from 1970 to 2000. That is WAY faster than evolution would work, and since eye glasses were about as good in 1970 as they are today there's no selective pressure. 

So environment has to be responsible for most of the change.  I read a couple papers indicating that playing/spending time outdoors as a young child is supposed to reduce incidence of nearsightedness, and people have known about the association with lots of close-up work like reading for hundreds of years. Not sure what the cause is, but its definitely not entirely genetic. ",t3_37qgcj,crpk6p6,t1_crpdm52,t1_crpk6p6

Trinity Force is his biggest powerspike and since I'm running scalling cooldown glyphs I need a 20% cdr item to reach the 40% cap at lvl 18. The only 20% cdr items are the new Black Cleaver, Frozen Heart, Morellonomicon and the Magus enchant if I recall correctly. In my opinion Black Cleaver is the best option I could pick up from this list, especially since I'm going Cinderhulk, the 400 extra health on the item is huge. 

And I don't like rushing Trinity Force on jungle Jax unless I'm snowballing hard. The build path is Cinderhulk &gt; Black Cleaver &gt; Trinity Force &gt; Blade of the Ruined King &gt; Randuin/Banshee/GA.

raisedbynarcissists,95,0,95,"OP, I'm going to make some suggestions that you may not like and that may sound less than supportive. However, as painful as they sound, it is my fervent hope that you will come out of this happier and far more independent of your mother than you are now. 

First, a mortgage for you under your current circumstances most likely won't even get out of the starting blocks. If you're only working part-time or freelance (which is very much a feast-or-famine situation to begin with), there's not a bank on the planet that will consider your application. You do _not_ need to be ""house poor"" (saddled with mortgage payments and little money for your other expenses) at a time like this. 

Her abusive behaviour is atrocious, certainly, but is by no means unique and there are strategies for dealing with narcissistic parents at a time like this. You've learned already that you cannot rely on your mother to provide material help or even moral support. What you do from here on out, I'm sorry to say, will have to be done on your own or with the help of people other than your mother. If you have other relatives or friends willing to help; if you can get additional hours at your part-time job or build up your freelance portfolio so that you have more material to publish or sell and more opportunities to get it published or sold, you'll be able to save up first to cover about a year's expenses (in case you find yourself without an income for a while), _then_ save up for a substantial down-payment on a house (considering at least 25% of the asking price as your down-payment). The more you have for a down-payment, the more readily the banks will give you a mortgage and, sometimes, the bigger the mortgage you'll be offered. Stick to the three-year rule, though - don't buy a house that would cost more than three years of your average income. 

In the meantime, I would suggest finding an apartment or similar accommodations to live in, away from and independently from your mother, as soon as you can manage it. Save up as much of your income as you can to pay for it; don't ask your mother for any financial help from now on and don't volunteer any information about any help you receive (like where you got the money from.) Once she sees that you're getting on without asking for her help, she'll be far more forthcoming with her offers of help. Don't accept her help when that happens: it's only offered so that she can hold it against you and manipulate you and your baby further.

CoonTown,32,0,32,"A historical investigation into the reason why Jews are thought to be a corrupting influence on disparate white societies is really beyond the scope of most reddit comments. Indeed, one could spend the next decade or so poring over the historical interplay between Jews, their host countries, their internal hierarchies, the nuances of their belief system, etc., etc., and only have scratched the surface. As such, I'm going to broad stroke this quite a bit, and I encourage you to lurk moar on /pol/ or such until you reach Jew enlightenment. 

First, I think it's important to qualify what we mean by the word ""Jew"" in the first place. As a noun, it is used to denote the followers of the  Jewish faith, as well as a genetically-distinct group of Semitic peoples who settled in and around the Levant circa ~4,000 years ago. However, when you see the word Jew thrown around in rightist spheres such as this, it takes on an additional context. I think the word ""Jew"" used here to is to denote a Jewish person of the international elite, an endorser of policies that are culturally destructive to white nations. Further complicating the usage of the word ""Jew"" is the fact that many times it is used as a shorthand for the international left and its followers; whether or not these people are are actually Jewish and/or biologically Semitic is often open to debate.

But, by and large, when you see ""Jew"" bandied about here, it means a Jewish person of the leftist persuasion.

Now, that Jews have an outsized/disproportionate showing in the Western world's departments of academia, finance, media, entertainment, law, and certain spheres of government is a matter of observable fact. As to why this is, the reasons become less certain and more theoretical. Jews, especially Ashkenazi Jews, are smart, on average; I think it's disingenuous to argue otherwise. However, it is a notable characteristic of many Jewish groups that they practice ethnocentric nepotism, and this may also account for the heavy Jewish presence in the aforementioned fields. 

The average Western, upper-middle class, secular Jew is almost always a progressive; note the non-religious (i.e. Hasidic or conservative) Jewish vote in a given election. They champion causes like social justice, and are widely thought to have developed the intellectual frameworks for feminism, critical theory, cultural Marxism, etc., etc. Certainly, almost all Jewish academics are astoundingly liberal.

Now, none of what I've written above would necessarily be a problem for white society if it were not for certain characteristics of the Jewish spirit. Whether or not these characteristics are genetic or cultural in origin is open to debate - I suspect a bit of both. Anyhow, off the top of my head, some common Jewish characteristics I've observed:

* They are intensely chauvinistic. They have a word - *goy* - that denotes anyone who is not a Jew.

* Tied in to the above, Jews do not seem to view the goyim as equal to themselves. This is of course confirmed in various interpretations of the Tanakh/Talmud, but even secular Jews seem to have an odd disposition to dislike and distrust the goyim on a population-wide scale. 

* Jews are histrionic, physically second-rate, and incredibly vindictive. There is a reason the neurotic Woody Allen or Jerry Seinfield is a caricature for the Westernized Jew. When these personality quirks are applied across a wide and influential population, the effects are often negative for the host population, which of course brings me to:

* Jews are a historically nomadic people. Since the destruction of the Second Temple to the founding of the state of Israel in 1948, Jews largely lived in various host countries throughout Europe. They were often expelled or outright terminated by the host countries for rending the social fabric of those nations and proto-nations. 

* The Jewish experience - that is, perceived persecution - has only furthered the extent to which Jews are unlikely to adopt the cultural norms of their current habitat. One can see this readily in the rich neighborhoods of Manhattan, where Jewish kids normally go to Hebrew school, then a heavily Jewish private school, then on to an Ivy League college, then directly into a field that is dominated by other members of the tribe. The time spent living among the goyim is kept to a minimum, especially the untouchable blue-collar goyim. 

* I believe their cultural experience has left them with a huge intellectual blindspot when it comes to honest science, particularly any genetics or evolutionary biology that would imply that some races are inferior in some catagories to others. Jewish intellectuals seem especially loathe to admit the superiority/inferiority of disparate groups of people; I suspect this is because, historically speaking, once these differences are accepted as fact, Jews often find themselves being shown the exit by the now-impassioned goyim.

* They seem to have an unending attraction to finance and financial markets; this is often thought of as sleazy or conniving by the various Jewish detractors found in these parts of the Internet. The true Jewish G-d seems not to be Yahweh so much as the almighty dollar (or shekel), and their perceived ability to twist another gold piece out of an economy no matter the human cost is disgusting to many non-Jews.

The list could go on for quite some time. Many great white philosophical thinkers of the past thousand years have been what you would call “anti-Semitic”, and the slights brought upon polite white society by the Jews – whether real or imagined – are nothing if not voluminous. 

Personally, I do not think all Jews are monstrous le happy merchants whose only wish is to promote the destruction of whites via race-mixing, gay marriage, or another protocol of Zion. It's hard to grow up in the environment I did and not have at least a few Jewish friends, after all. But I cannot deny that it seems whenever there is a political idea, academic meme, or societal radicalization that is intent on tearing the traditional social fabric of white society, a Jew will be the intellectual might behind it. Whether or not this is an active conspiracy by a shadowy cabal of super-Jew billionaires to destroy the white race, or simply a phenomenon based on the Jewish cultural position, I cannot say. In either case, it simply seems Jews in positions of power in Western society don't really seem to have the same interests or motivations as whites do, at least as far as non-liberal whites are concerned.

As to why they're hated on /r/coontown in particular, well, that's pretty simple. Jews are frequently seen as the cultural architects behind integration, multiculturalism, miscegenation, and a whole host of other great ideas that put whites and blacks together in ways one could argue never really occurred in nature before the mid-19th century. 

This post, although lengthy, is really just a primer on the matter of Jews in the West. I again urge you to do your own research on the matter. ",t3_37u753,crpy1iv,t1_crpvn0n,t1_crpy1iv

typography,3,0,3,"Lmfao, are we really going to start the em/en/single/double argument? After doing enough research on this you realize people parrot other sources ad nauseum to align with their confirmation bias, right? 

The crux of the issue is being able to visually separate sentences without increased cognitive load (i.e., getting in the way of the content). Since typefaces all have different proportions, it leads to spacing issues at different sizes. Some are meant better as display than text; which is why leading/kerning/typeface/sizes are considered in a design. Metal/wood/typewriter/whatever, it is about readability NOT correctness. Age can play a factor as well, even familiarity. This was an issue way before typewriters. Technology forces design decisions, people adapt. People want things make sense (e.g., bring order). Realize theory and hypothesis are just that. Just like life, design isn't binary. What works optimally for the design is more important than trying to support said design because someone citing someone saying it's right. Use of theory/hypothesis/opinion to test if a design works is what designers should be focused on, not if typewriters caused issues with readability... unless you're designing with a typewriter.",t3_37torz,crq06vu,t1_crpz1b3,t1_crq06vu

Also, if there were in fact an average of 3,000 legitimate txs being done on the network per second, that would mean the economy as a whole would be on the order of a thousand times larger than it is now, meaning hundreds of millions of additional users, increasing the likelihood of individuals with high-end connections, who could affordably run a full node, joining the network.",t3_37v4v9,crq30dw,t1_crq2my8,t1_crq30dw

Since posting the above AMA, I went out for a jog. I normally go to a nearby gym late at night, but I was feeling antsy and wanted to go earlier today. (I am also usually pale as a sheet from my indoor, semi-nocturnal life, and a little extra sun never hurt anybody.) But this time, I went to a local park, in the middle of the day. Way out of my usual.

Anyway, I finished my run and located a water fountain to rehydrate and cool off before driving home. It was near some soccer fields, but no one was using them so they were empty. As I walked back to my car, I saw something. Over in the grass, by some unmowed weeds and saplings.


An enormous bottle of Grey Goose vodka. No one and nothing around for a good 3/4 of a mile. So it's mine, now. A free bottle that would have cost around $70. And not only that, I've already finished my workout for today.

PPDPODCAST,1,0,1,"Alright, I can't link directly to the avfm article but it's this one I'm referencing: *Dan Perrins begins hunger strike at Queen’s Park Legislative Assembly* - May 14, 2015 By Paul Elam



&gt;The other issue is that of Canada’s governmental indifference to men who are experiencing abuse in intimate relationships. Earl Silverman tried for years to fight that fight with the Canadian government, with efforts to establish a funded shelter for male victims of DV. The government’s reaction was silence.

[This appears to be false.](http://www.splcenter.org/blog/2013/05/14/another-mens-rights-activist-suicide-exploited-by-ideologues/)



&gt;The odd thing is that links in Silverman’s own blog offer a more nuanced view of his story than his mourners do. Voluminous briefs and transcripts document how accommodating various officials were — assigning him a liaison, inviting him to conferences, scheduling interviews with ministers, granting him wide latitude when he failed to dot every bureaucratic “i” and cross every “t.” He also benefited from the  $1,000 benefit that is available to people of either gender who are fleeing domestic violence in Alberta. 

&gt;“Mr. Silverman appears incapable of coherent and rational problem solving with government or community partners,” Maria David-Evans, the exasperated deputy minister of Alberta Children’s Services wrote in a formal response to one of his suits. “This is clearly not because of discrimination or gender bias … but is based on the illogical, unjustifiable and unreasonable ideology needed to communicate his views about misandry conspiracies that he has come to believe.”

But back to Perrins

&gt;Dan has already delivered his demands at the footsteps of the Queen’s Park Legislative Assembly, who at first refused to even accept his demands for review. After some discussion they reversed and accepted the documents.

Now for the [WHTM article](http://wehuntedthemammoth.com/2015/05/13/canadian-mra-dan-perrins-launches-hunger-strike-demands-the-arrest-of-those-whove-libelled-him/), which references the quote from avfm above

&gt;But the document Perrins handed over — or at least the document that Esmay linked to — wasn’t a list of demands. It was a muddled manifesto titled “Men’s Rights March 2013 Internet Statement,” ending with a laundry list of goals for the Men’s Rights movement including “[d]evelopment and availability of a male fertility control device, drug or method that is safe, affordable, effective and reversible” and a call to “[f]oster the emergence of a new cultural narrative where all men and women are encouraged to live their lives as they see fit, without preferential treatment, while also being expected to bear the responsibility for their personal choices.”

Ok, so we can see why the Canadian government didn't want to accept them at first. 

Perrins later clarifies that those were *not* his demands, and instead he wants

&gt;1. full funding for men's DV shelters

&gt;2. that those who libel non-feminists be brought before a court of competent jurisdiction.

The problem with these demands, which avfm does not address, is that they are impossible for the Canadian government to fulfill:

&gt;The first demand is not only so vague as to be almost meaningless — what is “full funding,” how quickly would the government need to provide it?  But it also would require the government to do several impossible things.

&gt;Ontario’s premier Kathleen Wynne — as far as I can figure it, she’s the person Perrins expects to respond to his demands — cannot dramatically alter hundreds of millions of dollars of government spending with some dramatic proclamation in order to appease a man on a hunger strike. Or for any other reason; that’s not how government works.

&gt;Even if Wynne could suddenly produce “full funding for men’s DV shelters” out of a hat, where exactly would this money go? Domestic violence shelters don’t grow like flowers after you sprinkle the requisite amount of money on the ground. They have to be built, by devoted activists prepared to raise a lot of the money on their own, and prepared as well to deal with endless obstacles and opposition along the way.

&gt;The only reason we have DV shelters at all is because feminist activists built them, starting in a time when there was precisely zero government money to help them and a lot of public hostility towards even the idea of them.

&gt;Like a lot of Men’s Rights activists, Perrins seems to want a duplicate version of the network of DV shelters that feminist activists have worked for and fought for over the course of many decades to be simply bestowed upon MRAs by government fiat.

And we know that afvm at least has no intention of offering either financial or real-world support in the form of organizing activists to form said shelters. As for the demand that those who libel him be punished

&gt;Frankly, Perrins seems a good deal more invested in his second demand: that those who libel “non-feminists” be arrested and criminally charged.

&gt;This is not quite as bizarre a demand as it sounds: in addition to having extremely plaintiff-friendly civil libel laws, Canada also has criminal laws against “defamatory libel.” But, as Ontario’s Law Times reports, “[c]riminal charges for defamatory libel are rare in Canada.”

&gt;Further, according to one expert the Law Times spoke to,

&gt;&gt;[t]he line between what constitutes criminal libel and what constitutes the more commonly used civil libel is often blurred, and there’s doubt as to whether these criminal provisions are constitutional in the face of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms … .

&gt;Indeed, the Law Times notes, s. 301 of the Criminal Code — under which “anyone who publishes a defamatory libel is guilty of an indictable offence and can be imprisoned for up to two years” — has already been declared unconstitutional in four Canadian provinces, including Ontario, where Perrins is conducting his hunger strike.

&gt;Under section 300 of the Code, Canadians in these provinces can, at least theoretically, still be charged with criminal libel, but only if they know what they are publishing is false.

&gt;Perrins, for his part, claims he’s been libelled by Canada’s Sharp magazine, by GQ, and by other publications. He’s evidently angry at Sharp’s Alex Nino Gheciu for saying that

&gt;&gt;Perrins wrote a hateful missive against [a feminist activist], labelling her “Little Red Frothing Fornication Mouth” and posted her pictures and personal information online.

&gt;Well, Perrins did indeed write a hateful AVFM post attacking the activist in question, in which he called her “Little Red Frothing Fornication Mouth.” The post was accompanied by a drawing of the woman. But, as far as I know, Perrins did not himself post her personal information online, though it’s possible, I suppose, that the folks at Sharp know something I don’t.

&gt;Perrins seems angrier still at writer Jeff Sharlet, who, in his highly unflattering GQ account of AVFM’s summer 2014 conference, wrote that Perrins claimed to have taken the infamous red pill of Men’s Rightshood on

&gt;&gt;the day he ended up in jail, after he says he lodged a complaint against his ex, the beginning of a legal battle that led him to a hunger strike. “I should have killed the bitch five years ago,” he tells me. “I’d be out by now.” 

&gt;Unless Sharlet simply made up the quote, and GQ’s factcheckers let it stand, I’m not exactly sure how this would count as “defamatory libel.” It’s not libellous to quote what someone has said to you.

&gt;It’s not exactly clear to me what Perrins expects the Ontario government to do about any of this alleged libel. The Premier of Ontario cannot order the Canadian police to arrest all of those whom Perrins thinks have defamed him, nor would anyone with any sense want politicians to have this power.

&gt;It’s also not clear why Perrins doesn’t simply sue for libel in civil court instead of going on a hunger strike to compel the Ontario government to do things it cannot actually do.

Overall I found the avfm piece to be lacking in both credibility and important information relevant to Perrins' demands.

buildahackintosh,2,0,2,"As far as compatibility goes with Z97, I think all 4 major makers use AMI UEFI BIOS, so there's no issue here.

But -- WARNING -- I just started this hackintosh research last week so I actually **don't know** more than I think I know.

One issue I was learning about last night is that if you want to go with the ozmosis boot loader you have to worry about the BIOS being write-protected, and that makers are actually adding this write protection to later BIOS updates for some reason.

One compatibility issue I look for is having Intel (218) ethernet on the motherboard, since a working 802.3 en0 is necessary for access to the AppStore, and I trust Intel more than Killer or Realtek.

This board has M.2, but it's PCIe 2.0 4X that goes to the PCH (and actually deactivates the bottom slot if you use it, too) vs. ASRock's 3.0 4X that goes to the CPU directly.

M.2 to [CPU vs. PCH] isn't that big a deal I guess unless you've got the PCH &lt;-&gt; CPU bus otherwise saturated with traffic (it's PCIe 2.0 8x for all peripherals), but PCIe 3.0 4x is necessary to get full performance out of the SM-951.

One issue with SM-951 is that there will be an NVMe version out soon, which might be marginally faster and future-proof.

http://www.thessdreview.com/daily-news/latest-buzz/samsung-begins-mass-production-of-industrys-first-m-2-nvme-pcie-ssd-for-pcs-and-workstations/

OS X added NVMe support in 10.3.3, and the latest laptops have this SM-951 card (not sure if AHCI or NVMe tho)",t3_37yhaf,crqwnct,t1_crqw7t1,t1_crqwnct

They are comfortable and the mic sounds fine (from what I've been told in-game). I really enjoy the soft fabric material on the earcups. Not the cheap leathery material I've seen on other ""gaming"" branded headset. 

Lastly, wireless. It's so handy not having to worry about getting up to open the window or door or to help my lady with something she needs and having the cord get caught or tangled.

rocketbeans,13,0,13,"30 Jahre in der Mafia. Goodfellas erzählt die Geschichte eines Lebens voller Drogen, Gewalt, Sex und Macht. Über einen Jungen der davon träumt zu den ganz großen zu gehören und am Ende... ja wo landet er eigentlich? Er ist weder tot, noch im Gefängnis, noch bettel arm, noch liegt er reich am Strand. Er landet in einem Leben ohne Abenteuer und Ruhm. Und damit sind wir auch gleich bei meinem Hauptproblem mit dem Film: Seinem Hauptcharakter. 

Henry Hill ist ein Unsympath wie er im Buche steht. Er lebt das Leben eines Gangsters mit all seinen Vor- und Nachteilen und ist trotzdem komplett langweilig und blass. Er ist nicht der größte Psychopath im Film oder gar einfach nur ein Kerl der zum falschen Zeitpunkt am falschen Ort ist. Hill hat sich bewusst für seinen Lebensstil entschieden und bereut die Entscheidung zu keinem Zeitpunkt. Ein Mann ohne Ecken und Kanten. Genauso ergeht es seiner Frau. Beide passen perfekt zusammen und das ist auch das Problem. Wenn er sie betrügt oder wenn sie rumjammert, dass sie für ihn Drogenschmuggeln muss um Rechnungen zu bezahlen, dann empfindet man kein Mitleid mit ihr. Dieser Film löst viele Gefühl in einem aus, aber Mitgefühl ist zu keinem Zeitpunkt dabei. Wenn er aufwacht und seine Frau hält ihm eine Knarre ins Gesicht, dann ist die Sache spannend. Allerdings nicht weil man Angst um ihn hat, sondern weil man sich fragt, wie der Film wohl ohne ihn weiter gehen würde. Denn keiner von beiden macht eine echte Charakterentwicklung durch. Henry wird höchstens paranoider und sie wird hysterischer. Unterstützt wird dieses Gefühl der Gleichgültigkeit gegenüber den Hauptprotagonisten durch die indirekte Erzählweise der beiden. Wenn sie davon reden wie sehr sie sich der Konsequenzen ihres Handeln bewusst sind und wie noch egaler es ihnen ist, dann lässt es mich einfach kalt, wenn eben diese Konsequenzen eintreten. 

Soweit zu meinem größten und fast auch einzigen Kritikpunkt. Das Leben der Mafiosi wird richtig schön dargestellt und mann kann den Reiz den sie versprühen schon nachvollziehen. Die Kamerafahrten und die schauspielerische Leistung sind durchweg überzeugend. ""Findest du ich bin ein lustiger Typ?"" Ist eine wirklich grandiose Szene, die auch noch improvisiert wurde. Allgemein gehören die Dialoge in die oberste Liga, was Filme angeht. 

Ein Problem habe ich allerdings noch. Ich habe Sopranos vor Goodfellas gesehen. Im ersten Moment würde man meinen Sopranos ist Goodfellas die Serie, nur 20-30 Jahre später. Denn abgesehen vom vergleichbaren Setting und den Chrakteren, die man wieder erkennt, taucht auch die Hälfte des Goodfellas-Cast in Sopranos auf. Nun gehört Sopranos zu den besten Serien die ich je gesehen habe und das Ende ist für mich das perfekte Serienende. Warum ist das also ein Problem? Sopranos nimmt sich für eine ähnliche Geschichte 6 Staffeln Zeit und breitet das Innenleben der Charaktere bis ins kleinste Detail vor einem aus. Man versteht die Motivationen eines jeden Charakters, man lernt sie kennen. Bei Goodfellas habe ich dieses Gefühl auch nach 2 1/2 Stunden Film nicht.  Es braucht mehr als das Setting um mich zu überzeugen und eben diese Überzeugung macht für mich den Unterschied. Müsste ich beiden eine Wertung geben, dann wäre Sopranos eine 10 und Goodfellas eine 7,5 oder so. Vielleicht sind Mafia-Film auch generell kein Genre das mich vom Hocker haut und Sopranos war hier einfach nur die Ausnahme...

***TL;TR*** Dieser Film macht kaum etwas wirklich falsch und handwerklich ist er nahe zu perfekt, aber der blasse Hauptcharakter und der fehlende Tiefgang im Vergleich zu Sopranos schmälern das Filmerlebnis für mich persönlich doch sehr. Dennoch ist Goodfellas ein Klassiker den jeder gesehen haben sollte, der Interesse an Mafia-Filmen hat. Hätte ich diesen Film früher gesehen, dann würde ich ihn wahrscheinlich anders beurteilen, aber so vergleiche ich in meinem Kopf Serie und Film aber durchgehend miteinander und dagegen kann ich leider nicht viel machen.

Ich hoffe man kann meine Kritikpunkte nachvollziehen und ihr kommt damit klar, dass es auch Leute gibt, die für diesen Klassiker keine feurigen Reden schwingen.",t3_34fuay,cqui0g4,t3_34fuay,t1_cqui0g4

If you can switch from your plan, try this one if possible. Great support and quite funny.

I actually had 6 gb of data in the month normally, but then because of a small branch falling apart, my actual provider (hi) stopped and it became fully kpn, since then I get 2 gb of data each month on top of my normal plan for free.
And since last week my provider was mistaken, if you have other services from your provider in your home, then you get double mb and minutes or even discounts. They added me to it, but we didn't actually have a service by them. Called them, they said that they would look into it, come back and say, well as long as it works, have fun;) .

But back to the topic, I will try to find a showcased 640xl and try it out you got me with all you've said.

One night she confessed that she had wanted to have sex with me since the first day we met.  So I'm thinking ""Great! Why not? What could possibly go wrong?""  So we had sex...

After that night things got, weird...

First it was just at work, where she took every opportunity to follow me around the premises whenever she could.  Literally - like a puppy, and always talking about having sex again.  I started feeling a little bad for her at this point and told her that I wasn't really interested in a serious relationship.  We had had a great time and we should just leave it at that.

She then proceeded to ask everyone at work for my cellphone number, which some asshole eventually gave her.  Then the calls started.  Sometimes 20 or more calls a day!  Bear in mind that this was all after working hours.  At this point I just used my land line from home and never turned my cell on after closing time.

I eventually spoke with HR at work about her following me all over the place and calling non-stop, and as a result she was put on probation.  Two days later she just stopped coming to work.  I asked my manager what had happened and he only replied ""She doesn't work here anymore.""

""Great! problem solved, right?""

WRONG.

I found out from someone in the accounting department that she had been fired for breaking into the manager's office and stealing employee files.  In particular MY employee files.  ""Oh my god, thanks for telling me nobody!""  Now she knew where I lived.

That same night I came home to a wide-open front door.  I immediately got back into my car and left and called to police.  After I saw a few police cruisers pull into the parking lot I pulled in myself.  I told one of the officers that it was my place and I had called about a break-in.  He told me to wait in the cruiser and someone would be by to take a statement in a few minutes.  

""What the hell? Am I on trial here? I didn't break in my own place after all.""

A few minutes later I hear an ambulance... 

She had broken into my apartment, got into the tub and slit her wrists.  Luckily she did it wrong and the ambulance got there quickly enough that she survived.  After that it was impossible to shower in that place and I had to move.  Shortly afterward I quit that job.

**tl;dr - don't stick your dick in crazy.**

 * Yes. Sadly, this really happened.

 * No, I had no idea she was unstable till after the sex.  It was like flipping a light switch.  She acted perfectly normal till then.

 * Username is a lot less dramatic than this, I used to manage a comic shop and had a lot of nerdy minions. (not the job where this took place)

So, it's possible. Not likely, but possible. It's sorta weirding me out that she would share a toothbrush with her roommate. That's also something that's ""possible but not likely"" in my book. Yuck!

That's why over in europe the muslim populations are far greater and sadly britain and europe has to deal with sjws and muslims.

japan is bad because their birth rate is just as low(1.3 or 1.4 iirc) but no one immigrates there and china has a seperate issue where there are too many boys compared to girls because of their birthing policy from before. which actually wasnt that bad you just had to pay extra taxes. 

i'm not sure we should be celebrating the declining birth rate, we still need white people but demographics that are favorable for birthing and reproducing just arent doing it.

Pets,6,0,6,"As everyone else has said, it's perfectly within your rights to go get a second opinion, but everything your vet has done so far has been perfectly reasonable IMO. If you don't feel like your pet is getting appropriate care, go to another vet, but I suspect your current vet just isn't communicating/explaining their thought processes well. If you give them a call, they should be willing and able to explain their treatment choices and discuss options with you if you feel unhappy with the outcome. Express your frustration and see what they think the next step should be! 

It sucks that your dog feels crappy now, but puppies get skin infections quite regularly, which are treated with antibiotics. All drugs have side effects, and antibiotics are no different. They can kill all the normal bacteria in the gut that are essential for normal stool consistency and GI health. So developing diarrhea after a course of antibiotics is not unusual, and it's normally treated with probiotics (plus or minus other things at the vet's discretion). The fact that the diarrhea came back is concerning, and the fact that it's combined with vomiting is a sure sign that you should return to the doctor. 

Is the ER you visited the same as your regular vet or are they staffed by different vets? Were any tests offered at the ER? Did they give you an explanation for the vomiting episode? From your description, though I don't know and haven't examined your pet, I would expect more testing to be offered at this point unless there was some obvious reason for the vomiting and diarrhea. It could be entirely unrelated to the skin issue, which was entirely unrelated to the hernia. 

This sounds like a very frustrating series of events, but unfortunately, sometimes pets are unlucky and have multiple illnesses in a short time frame. And unfortunately, figuring out the cause of illness (especially GI illnesses or skin illnesses) can be very frustrating because there's not always an easy test that will give you an immediate correct diagnosis.

Ah okay, I get what you're saying but I still believe both qualify as tech demos.

&gt; One is kinda cool. The other is really cool. I prefer the really cool stuff. And for events like the one in the vid the latter make a lot more sense imo. 

Personally I found Valve's DOTA 2 demo on integrated graphics to cooler because the results in quality of experience were more tangible for me.

I'm generally sceptical (on the software front) of predictions of how and when graphical fidelity will advance in the long term (or even a couple years.) The predictions for ubiquity always fall short because the market hasn't had a chance to dictate what level of detail a team can afford to integrate.

In other words, what we can get usually isn't what we do get. I'm the grumpy old man see? :P

In terms of hardware demos I get much more excited for what's just over the horizon. Maybe that's because there is more predictability in scaling and release cycles. IDK, but I realise that is a bit of a contradiction.",t3_34ii7e,cqvhau3,t1_cqvgjcl,t1_cqvhau3

I can't respond to this, considering that you are using a word which means a certain thing and then changing its definition. Okay, let's say that 'real love' is, as you put it, something that we can all make ourselves do. I still don't see how a gay man could will himself to have sex with a woman every night or vice versa. Surely he would be unhappy.

I can just look at the world around me and make reasonable conclusions when enough evidence is presented to me.

If all humans can be taught to be gay, then why is it so hard for humans to be taught to straight? Why do conversion therapy patients get severly depressed and even experience suicide because they failed? We've done countless studies on conversion therapies from pain inducing ones to hypnosis, yet none of them have ever been proven to work. Yet you think a liberal film can make people gay? What on earth are you talking about? Sexuality is multi-faceted and incredibly complicated, you can't just make someone straight just as you cant make a straight person gay. It just does not work. This is what I mean when I say you need evidence for your claims. Have you bothered reading the countless stories of LGBT Christians in this sub? Barely any of them have had a happy process dealing with this. And in a world where gay people can't have sex, marry, adopt, who would choose that kind of lifestyle? Do you think it's a popularity thing? Just as someone would choose to be a vegetarian or a hippie or a hipster or a rockabilly music lover? You can't force someone who loves all the specific features of a woman, knock them on the head and leave them running for other men, just as I cant make you gay. I think maybe you should consider that this 'hetero' friend of yours was just hiding his emotions out of fear and one day couldn't take it anymore and went on a self destructive streak. It isn't uncommon in the LGBT community.

DotA2,2,0,2,"Silver Edge doesn't give as good attributes as scythe despite the attributes on Scythe sucking. (16 vs 20)

Silver Edge doesn't disable the enemy's spells, which is pretty huge when those spells are stuns, or when they have octarine core, or when they have abilities to blink/jump away or become invulnerable.

Lastly, scythe disables the enemy target's damage dealing capability a bit more than Silver Edge, since it disables by 40% for 5 seconds (effectively 2 seconds of complete damage dealing disable), while scythe disables by 100% for 3.5 seconds, which is *75% longer*. It is no contest.

The only thing Silver Edge has that makes it remotely worth taking is that it can be used instead of blink dagger. That said, it makes initiations a lot slower, as well as harder or impossible to pursue enemies that blinked or jumped or force-staffed away, and flat out won't work to initiate in cases where the opposing team has detection.",t3_3469qh,cqvm4wg,t1_cqsfhus,t1_cqvm4wg

legaladvice,31,0,31,"Sounds like a horrible experience all around and glad that you made it home and with your luggage (eventually). 

For the luggage issue, although it seems counterintuitive the procedure is correct -- when multiple interlining carriers (AA and AC in this case) are involved, the delivering/final carrier is responsible for reuniting you with your luggage and investigating/paying out for  loss/damage and then seeking reimbursement from upline carriers -- even if it's more-or-less obvious who actually delayed/lost/misrouted your luggage.

Aside from that you can file a complaint with the US DOT (airlines tend to react promptly to those and the DOT keeps track of statistics), you can also write to the airline (real paper in an envelope works much better).

Finally, if you carefully review the Contract of Carriage/International General Rules Tariff (COC is [here](http://www.aa.com/i18n/customerService/customerCommitment/conditionsOfCarriage.jsp?anchorLocation=DirectURL&amp;title=conditionsofcarriage)) you may find specific provisions that you can leverage in either your DOT complaint or letter to the airline.

OrthodoxChristianity,3,0,3,"Welcome! I came to Orthodoxy through a similar path. I was an off-and-on agnostic Buddhist for about a decade, started reading about Christianity, and that eventually led me to Orthodoxy. While I was preparing to become Orthodox I was meditating quite a bit and I had a beautiful experience of God very similar to the one you describe, lasting about a day. I can't really explain it, but I felt an immense peace and freedom.

That said, for me, it was not theosis or enlightenment because ultimately it was not an abiding experience. And I spent a long time trying to get that experience back--this was a mistake, of course. These kinds of things are given freely by God, not achieved by saying the right prayers or doing the right practices. Real theosis or enlightenment is a total, persistent freedom.

But to answer your first question, yes, I absolutely think that non-Christians can have these kinds of experiences and reach theosis.

Those are some great books to read and they are definitely mainstream Orthodoxy. I really like Olivier Clement's *The Roots of Christian Mysticism*, which is a kind of ""reader"" of the Fathers with commentary. I would also recommend--although, yes, he is Catholic--books by Thomas Merton, especially *New Seeds of Contemplation* and *No Man Is An Island*. He's one of the greatest 20th century Christian spiritual writers.

I would recommend talking to an Orthodox priest, as others have suggested. However, many (most?) parish priests don't deal with this kind of thing that often. I was lucky to have one who knew exactly what I was talking about. He might point you toward some reading or a monk you could talk to who has more experience with hesychasm. And there are certainly a share of Orthodox who are religious, but not spiritual. That's inescapable.

Anyway, please feel free to PM me if you'd like to talk more.",t3_34ji6s,cqvph5u,t3_34ji6s,t1_cqvph5u

Past that, John Wayne Gacy had a homicide rate of 3300% - 3400% -- does that mean that I am more likely to be killed by Gacy (presuming that he had not died in '94) than by a drunk driver or a police officer?

What I've learned:

* **Oil Cleansing** is amazing. It was the first thing I did that helped me see an immediate reduction in my oil production. I've found oil cleansers with emulsifiers work best for my skin, so far I've tried three and I really like them all!

* **Drinking more water** is something that I majorly slack with but I know my oily skin is linked to dehydration. If I'm not drinking a cup of water an hour my skin really lets me know that is simply unacceptable and to up my intake. 

* **Gel Moisturisers** are my best friend.

* **Chemical Exfoliation** isn't scary and is more gentle however, sometimes less really is more. I conflated using a higher percentage with needing a higher frequency of use. I needed a higher AHA percentage, but I really don't need to use it every night. Twice a week is more than plenty. 

* **Honey &amp; Propolis** - My skin drinks this stuff up like it is the nectar of the gods. I can't even describe how my skin just loves this combination. 

* **Washing my skin less** - has been kind of a struggle for me. But  over a few months I've dropped the oil cleanser in the morning, and only used the foam cleanser. Now I only use water and konjac. My skin really really appreciates being babied in the morning. ",t3_34m2ti,cqvyyrw,t3_34m2ti,t1_cqvyyrw

I cannot comment on the past, but this current SKT roster is extremely good, even with Easyhoon and TOM playing. I do not mean to discredit SKT, they are the number one team in the number one region.

The rating ""OK"" basically means ""not shit"", and you would probably want to differentiate between 3 or 4 grades within that: ""Awesome""-""Good""-""OK""-""Meh"" to get a more insightful impression of what the community thinks about the maps.*

Now, if you pull your GPA up to a B+, you might be able to get in. I'm not trying to be a dick, but if you get your average up by loading up on easy classes to artificially boost your GPA, do you really think you're ready for doing an MSc?

Comcast,3,0,3,"Comcast is responsible for the line coming into the house (it's called a ""drop"") up to the point where it reaches the ground block. Usually the ground block is located at the side of the house in a grey security box.  From the ground block to your equipment would be the homeowner's responsibility. If you don't own the property, then technically your landlord would be responsible for repairs to the wiring. 

FWIW Comcast techs aren't pressured to bill customers, they just complete the work order honestly and the system generates a charge if warranted. Most of the techs I know do the opposite and try to save customers money when they can. For example, if you get a little old lady that has her TV on the wrong input, most techs will go outside and change a connector or the ground block so there is no charge. 

If you are worried about $$$ sign up for the [Service Protection Plan](http://forums.comcast.com/t5/Basic-Internet-Connectivity-And/Connection-Troubleshooting-Tips/td-p/1253575). You have to keep it for 2 months and it's around $5 a month. You can sign up with the tech when he/she arrives.

news,1145,0,1145,"You have this slightly backwards. That's understandable, it's quite confusing.

By default, the federal government has sovereign **immunity**. This means they **cannot be sued**.

Congress passed a law that **waives immunity** so the government **can be sued**.

However, the law has an **exception to the waiver of immunity** for ""intentional torts"" like assault, battery, etc. For those the government **cannot be sued**.

The law enforcement proviso carves out an **exception to the exception to the waiver of immunity** when police are involved, so when police do an intentional tort, the government **can be sued**.

The judge, in this case, determined that the law enforcement proviso doesn't apply because the conduct didn't fall under ""intentional torts"" but instead fell under a different exception to the waiver of sovereign immunity, the ""discretionary function exemption"", and the law enforcement proviso only applies to the intentional torts exemption.

relationships,0,0,0,"&gt; This offends me. Am I wrong? I feel like I've done a LOT for her. I don't want to watch her and her child be in danger.

This isn't about you.  That's the first thing you have to realize.  She is caught in a cycle of abuse, and she has been so mixed up mentally that it just makes sense to go back to this man.  So, although I understand being offended, think of it as something that you have no control over - because you don't.  You've made the best decision for you, and cut her out of your life, but you can't control her responses and wasting excess energy on them is useless.

You won't get her to see reality.  You really can't.  What is going to help you, though, is reading up on abused women which will help you understand her situation and her reaction.",t3_34mqps,cqwhu3j,t3_34mqps,t1_cqwhu3j

breakingmom,10,0,10,"Her ""official"" ones are Mood Disorder NOS, ODD, Adjustment Disorder, Depression.

When she was in Rockville they diagnosed her as Bipolar, but here they say ""probably underlying bipolar"" because of her age. They also think she's borderline and/or histrionic but again won't officially diagnose her. This is where I have an issue, because I feel that they're allowing her to make herself a victim and feeding into it. It's ""well you don't visit unless it's therapy"" ""I can't see you, it's too stressful"" when we do try to visit other than therapy. She constantly is unsafe and loses day passes, but that's our fault because we set the bar too high (DON'T FUCKING ATTACK PEOPLE and you get a day pass..Don't try to kill yourself and get a day pass). Where she is now says it's our fault she's acting out because we confront her with her behavior, we're supposed to pretend it's rainbows and butterflies (she attacked tinynurse who was 2, she tried to poison us, she attacked us, she slammed a kids head into the ground while laughing, tried to stab a kid when she was in regular school..there's so much more, my point being, we're supposed to congratulate her for brushing her hair and showering and ignore the psychopathic behaviors).

I really do question if she's not really a psychopath. 

As for when, hindsight is 20/20 and I'd say six or seven or earlier.

I'm going to edit to add, when she was in Devereux and they were confrontational she did the best she ever has. The doctor there was very matter of fact, your actions are the reason for this and this is what you make it be.",t3_34mpeg,cqwi0ze,t1_cqwhcsa,t1_cqwi0ze

I love traveling and move once a year or so, so that wouldn't be a problem. My family can help a bit, but they're somewhat tight on money and have already helped me with the whole mouthguard route etc. I am on fully subsidized Obamacare here in Washington. I don't know what's going to happen yet with surgery, but goddamn that shit saved me. I've been able to go to doctors without copays, get all my prescriptions without paying a cent, even go to the emergency  room when things got too painful. Anyways, we'll see soon with my shoulder how much they will cover. My blood flow to my arm cuts off completely so I'm going through with that regardless. 

Out of curiosity, what were some of the other effects of your ordeal? Physically, mentally, etc? My body feels like it's trying to clench itself into a pretzel, even when I'm asleep. My brain gets stuck on things a lot, when things are bad my speech gets weird. I have to be hyperaware or else I'll rage on people and loose my shit even though that's the polar opposite of my ""true"" personality. As I said above, I don't particularly want to be dead, but I wouldn't really mind. If I could choose to go into a coma for a couple years I'd do it this instant. Anyways, wondering if you dealt with any peripheral shit like that. I've been going downhill for a decade or so, and I know this experience will be a part of me forever even if I lose the pain.

Complexity does not equal depth.  A great deal of games that are carefully designed can have more depth with less complexity. Consider chess. Or some of Sirlin's games.  I feel like Heroes has a great deal of depth, and the ones who don't think so are like the people in the video described their initial position.

But who knows. Maybe random people on reddit are right and the challenger league LoL players that have crossed over and find the game deep are just somehow much worse at Heroes than they were at LoL.

In Canada, big banks didn't crash the economy by pretending risky mortgages were AAA securities (thanks to the US gov't repealing the Glass-Steagall Act) and then get bailed out with tax money while homeowners were left totally fucked. This is partly why Occupy Vancouver fizzled out.

Lastly, Vancouver's drug of choice is weed while Seattle's is booze.",t3_34qj5x,cqx48sm,t3_34qj5x,t1_cqx48sm

bettafish,3,0,3,"hiya! Don't worry, loads of people start out like this, it's great you decided to get a larger tank soon! 

For now, you could do daily 50% water changes  or every other day whichever you prefer. Add dechlorinator (the fizzing tablets?) every time you do the change, and make sure the water temperatures match. If you see that the fish is less scared when you remove him, do so, otherwise you can leave him in there. Most bettas are fairly shy and stressed the first day (travel, new home, new water etc.), so don't worry too much about that. In general, bettas are prety hardy, so I'm sure he'll survive. If you can, find a warm spot for his tank, it'll make him more lively and happier :)

Finrot is usually the result of poor water conditions, if you can keep his tank clean it'll eventually heal up on it's own. You could use regular uniodized salt, I believe the measurement is 1 tsp per gallon. I used this [guide](http://www.bettafish.com/showthread.php?t=25297) to get rid of my bettas nasty case of rot.

[Here is a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/bettafish/comments/1r80c7/you_asked_i_delivered_betta_care_sheet/) with some of the basic care and information. I'd also like to add that betta specific water treatments are bs. The regular water dechlorinator (e.g. seachem prime) is much better and usually much cheaper as well.

Both genders are equally oblivious; men because they seem to be baffled by the situation (being asked out), women because they can't seem to process that I'm not straight (I don't look like a lesbian stereotype). But guys have this unintentional wall up, like they just refuse to socially cooperate with the situation (I don't mean say yes, more like...their gears get stuck, and they can't react properly; a yes, a polite no, anything), whereas girls generally feel obligated to respond, they'll say sure, or very politely inform you that they're not interested in women, or just no thank you.

But then again, I think the whole situation is self-perpetuating. Girls don't ask guys out because guys react like weirdos. Guys react like weirdos because they're unfamiliar with the situation, because they're never asked out. They don't grow up with the same sort of media/pop-cultural instructional guide on how to handle being asked out. Guys get ""how to ask her out"" and girls get ""how to be asked out"".

EDIT: by instructional guide, I mean basically all of the TV shows, movies, songs, etc, in which guys are usually depicted as trying to figure out ""how to get the girl"", and girls tend to be assigned the role of ""recipient"". This sets up the real-life standard and expectation that this is how things do or even SHOULD go.

There were many signs like that—the clearest was for a xiaojie to smoke a cigarette in public, because when a Fuling woman did that you could be almost certain that she was a prostitute. Li Jiali was not smoking but **the show of painting her face was bad enough.** She tried several times to get my attention until at last I looked over. “Ho Wei,” she said, “your American name is Pete, isn’t it?” “Yes.” She had asked me this the first time we met, and now **I regretted telling her.** She asked if I would take her to lunch today, and I decided that **I had had enough.** “I already have a girlfriend,” I lied. “That’s okay,” Li Jiali said. “It doesn’t matter if you have a girlfriend.” “I have to go now,” I said. “I don’t want to eat lunch.” I pulled away, slipping into the crowd, and the man whispered in my ear, “What’s your guanxi with her?” “There’s no guanxi. I don’t know who she is. **She bothers me.”** “You don’t have any interest in her?” “No, not at all.”


The sheer derision that Hessler expresses for this woman is disturbing. Any other writer in the world would welcome this opportunity to chat with a woman of her ilk and glean some insight into their subculture. His haughty opinion of working woman carries over into all of Hessler's other books and writings as well. For someone who otherwise so brilliantly portrays life in China, I'll never understand why Hessler has so much open contempt for xiaojie, except that he and/or his publisher is desperately trying to please his middle-American readership.",t3_34scb2,cqxopq5,t1_cqxo7k6,t1_cqxopq5

&gt;I want to suggest it to you today. BABYMETAL stand on the same stage as Slipknot in 2015 ROCK ON THE RANGE. I recommend that you see BABYMETAL in straight eyes. There is not the band having Haters more than BM in this Fest. There is much Hayter's expecting their failure. They [know](http://livedoor.blogimg.jp/bbmt46/imgs/8/c/8c7a0ce5.jpg) that oneself are hated in ""Haters"". However, they don't complain either and don't argue. Their answer is simple. They only provide the best stage to the audience. And, They [understand](http://livedoor.blogimg.jp/bbmt46/imgs/9/9/99fd82d9.jpg) this thing and [stand](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/BsLwFHeCIAA4ij6.jpg) in the stage. I want you to imagine it how long their efforts piled up. [Their childhood](http://i.imgur.com/Ryy8qna.jpg) was devoted for the ""future"". Therefore they had to advance [before](http://livedoor.blogimg.jp/metalboy/imgs/5/c/5c7b9cb1.jpg). Their fights aren't ""Sweet"" or ""Pop"",It is surely ""Tough"".
You may surely understand this meaning.
 
&gt;Look at the [SU's eyes of this photo](http://i.imgur.com/2vut1gn.jpg)[Main Vo:Girl of left]. This photograph is BABYMETAL before the [SONISPHERE2014](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn-yDtAtM7k) appearance. Surely she will become the legend in the future. SU keeps a huge monster in a [heart](http://livedoor.blogimg.jp/webimage-babymetal/imgs/a/4/a494b0b4.jpg). However, she who [went down the stage](http://i979.photobucket.com/albums/ae278/sayuminsayumin5/sakura/331suzuka1-270x480.jpg) is like a nerd,and [slightly awkward](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4bRyiF7vG0).

They are the [""future""](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1vAu4tpvlVg/VLPGIijctxI/AAAAAAAADXU/bD6PowJhN98/s1600/2014-07-11-58.jpg) of Rock/Pops Music.
We have [various encounters](http://cs540107.vk.me/c620718/v620718352/1c3bb/nuFdPDitQJk.jpg) in the life.
You will thank for your judgment in the future, if you are devoted to a faithful witness.
 
&gt;I recommend ""[LIVE AT BUDOKAN -RED NIGHT-](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WlLDNFIHO4)"" if you listen to BABYMETAL for the first time.
""[LIVE AT BUDOKAN -RED NIGHT-](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Live-at-Budokan-Limited-Edition/dp/B00PF9F42K/ref=pd_sim_sbs_m_h__2?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=1VP167QKXBA3XNMBQSH5)"" is higher in completeness than 1st album.
And listen to ""Akatsuki"". It has terribly high completeness.
Finally,Please sing [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9sjK5Km9Wc) with them if you participate in their live.
It is Anthem of their determination.

KingdomHearts,5,0,5,"From what I understand, Keyblades are unlocked by a person's heart being strong enough to use one. The Keyblade Inheritance Ceremony serves as a catalyst to unlock a person's ability to use a Keyblade. 

Terra performs the ceremony on Riku in BBS, so when Destiny Islands begins to fall to Darkness, a/the Keyblade begins seeking a savior (apparently the heart of worlds can also influence Keyblades, as seen by keychains some theorize, so maybe Destiny Island's heart ordered for there to be Keyblade wielder). However, since Riku had already been corrupted by Darkness, the Keyblade recognized Ventus' heart within Sora and deemed him worthy of being able to use a Keyblade. This is when Sora got his own unique Keyblade (not Ventus' or Terra's or Riku's).

When Sora and Riku encounter each other in Hollow Bastion, Riku recognizes that they Keyblade Sora uses should have been his and takes it back from Sora (other Keyblade wielders have been able to hold/use other wielder's Keyblades). However, Sora's strong heart causes him to regain the ability to use his Keyblade and he takes it back from Riku. 

Riku, who also has a strong heart, decides to use Maleficent's Keyblade at this point and he keeps it until he's finally able to unlock his own ability to use a Keyblade for himself (the Way to the Dawn).

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but basically, everyone has their own Keyblades for the most part. Roxas and Xion throw a wrench into the plan a little though...",t3_34ww5p,cqyuwa2,t3_34ww5p,t1_cqyuwa2

AskReddit,2458,0,2458,"Talk about chores before you move in together, what are your expectations of each other. Do you like to do one specific task over another? Does she hate doing something? Talk it out, compromise and honestly make a chore chart so you both know what is already done and what needs to be done still. 

You are going to get on each others nerves, it's normal. My husband to this day (12 years later) still cannot fathom WHY I feel the need to use a different glass for each type of beverage, and I can't figure out why he wants to throw away all the dishes except for 1 plate, 1 fork, 1 knife, 1 spoon, and 1 glass each.

You are going to fight about stupid things, and that is also normal. Just remember that you are both not mind readers, and just because you noticed something that needed to be done or put up, doesn't mean that your Girlfriend noticed it. Example, I notice when we are running out of hand soap and my husband doesn't (he will just start using dish soap or a bar of soap rather than refill the soap dispenser) and it gets on my nerves so badly.

When you both get home from work the first thing out of your mouths should never be ""Well I saw this when I got home and you should have taken care of it."" I don't care how long you have been stewing over it, ask them how their day was, talk to each other, then bring it up later. No sense in starting the evening off on a fight. (source, I have done this to my husband multiple times)

Always talk out big purchases, you both have your own income sure, but if you are in this for the long run, talk out any major purchases before hand. Not saying you need permission, but lets say you want a new couch, maybe your girlfriend has an opinion on the couch, ask her. Go out, go shopping together and find something you both like.

Now it is also awesome to live together too, I just pointed out the bad stuff because it is the stuff that can sometimes overshadow the good stuff going on. We both love to sit and watch Netflix together, we do swordfighting, when the dishes pile up we get together and do them together, alternating who washes and who dries. We talk during those times, and make jokes. Last night in particular *queue foul batchelorette frog meme* I was talking about how I could feel my leg hair when the wind blew and he said ""Ewww"" which sparked a 30 minute laugh-a-thon about how he has TONS of leg hair and he never noticed it before I said something. I went out of my way to blow on his legs the rest of the night just to mess with him.

You are both going to find qualities in each other that is really damn irritating, but you are also going to find out qualities that are completely endearing :) Husband and I moved in together after 6 months of dating, and we have made it 12 years now.

You gobble up TRP's bullshit like your hypothetical sloots gobble cock, so I'm pretty confident that your personality is akin to Cancer. You can cover that up with being funny, but you can't hide that shit that well. People are going to read you.

Whoooosh. I mean, if you read TRP and go ""Yes, yes this is spot on. This applies to most women I am interested in enough to evaluate."" Then chances are the women you're interested in are as shitty as you.

SubredditDrama,1,0,1,"&gt;Parody and mockery are two different things. Parody and satire are productive uses of humor that point out problems within something using absurdity the create contrast. Mockery is not productive. It alienates and excludes. 

Yes there is a difference, but both are done to every other religion. Because jokes are fun after all. We joke about politicians, religious figures, political viewpoints and what not, why should one religion be the exception.

&gt;What you're doing is saying that one guy saying, ""Here's what I don't like and here's why,"" is just as valuable as the guy saying, ""You suck,"" and then pointing and laughing until you leave the room. 

Well that isn't what I meant, I thought I made it clear here ""I agree that it shouldn't be just for the sake of outrage"" that just joking at someone until they react is something I disagree with.

Blackfellas,2,0,2,"Agreed wholeheartedly on all those respects, I remember being hugely pro-Hillary until the first time I saw Obama speak at some local event.  That being said I think it is a pretty dangerous precedent to set for us to have pundits tell us who is/isn't fit to be the candidate.  One of my biggest issues with Hillary (there are many) is the idea that she is being forwarded as the ""obvious"" choice, and just as occurred with Obama people are quick to discount Sanders as an impossibility.  The GOP field is at the moment filled with clowns, I don't think it is a good thing to have the Democratic party approve Hillary by default just because we assume she can win.

I realize it is unreasonable, and that it is the sort of thing I'd one day regret but I suspect it would be better to end up with a GOP president than it would be to rubber stamp the same sort of ""Its my turn"" politician that the GOP attempted previously with Mitt Romney.

soccer,-6,0,-6,"you've expressed this sentiment like 5 or 6 times. i don't know what you expect to change every time you bring it up again.

you and natrolleon are literally the archetype for the problems of the reddit american migration to football. i have no problems with american supporters, I have huge problems with american supporters who watch for 2 seasons then start to speak with an air of authority. One merely has to breeze down your user page to see you do not know what you're talking about when it comes to actual football beyond 'this dude played well' and 'this dude did not.'

your (and your more guilty of this than Natrolleon) overwhelming bias precludes you from having the slightest productive discussion and the sheer blaise attitude you display when you're proven wrong is positively maddening. You're never 'wrong', unfortunate things just happen to your predictions.

I was scrolling through some /r/coys postmatch threads after your defeat against City and there you were saying Lamela was worth his enormous transfer fee because of a home defeat to City and there you were, wildly satisfied with a home defeat to a very disappointing and underachieving City squad.

You're the worst. And it's not because I'm a gooner. I think if I supported Spurs I'd find you even more intolerable.

Natrolleon keeps his mouth shut about football issues more often than not, which makes him more endearing. But he's a big goofball in a weird way so it's more fun to mess with him. You're just infuriating.",t3_34yhpv,cqzkbmd,t1_cqzk4op,t1_cqzkbmd

technology,0,0,0,"Hmm, it appears I didn't articulate that we'll at all, I'll try again.

If the majority uses screw guns, then that will dictate the processes and practices that determine the methodology of work. Screw drivers have room for ergonomic and mechanical improvement still, but the fact that a $30 screw driver loses its value in the presence of a screw gun means that those improvements are not likely to happen. 


People tend to choose the option that requires the lowest amount of initial effort, and while the screw driver ensures no broken drill bits or stripped screw heads it represents more initial effort. We are left with a   environment where it is not feasible to further develop the ergonomics and mechanical functionality of the screw driver, in spite of its superior end product, as the appeal of the faster and easier to use screw gun outweighs the fact.


Therefor your request for the superior functionality of the manual tool is going to be eroded by the popular demand for the more accessable automaton, as this has generally been the way technology progresses.

It would explain the talk he always has with Simon about getting a new life, new purpose et cetera (his job at the CCC is the way he found to repent, when given a new chance). He was not a local so people wouldn't notice his death/resurrection.

Also, he might have returned a few years later than his death, which would allow him to look younger than 50 (assuming the other returned people age, unlike Henry).

Here a brief story of my own:
7 MC's until age of 37.  Right after I turn 37 we decided to give it one shot at IVF.  By that time I was only showing 7 follicles on CD3 and was not accepted at a local clinic.  

I knew the chances of successful IVF with PGS are slim ~15%.  I still wasn't ready to give up.  We barely had enough money to afford 1-2 cycles of IVF or 1 cycle of DIVF.  With that in mind i chose a clinic where I can easily transition from one program to another.  I knew that if I start stimming and things so south I will still be able to keep the money and move it to DIVF. 

Shit went south.  My follicles left me, there was nothing to stim and I didn't want to keep postponing things and keep hoping for a miracle that may never happen.  DIVF is what we went with.  It worked on the first try(we included PGS to reduce the chance of MC).   Little creature is kicking me from the inside as I type this.

This is all a very personal decision.  We also applied for foster to adopt but we knew that it's not as easy process.  I consulted with 3 different RE's and all of them gave me 75%-80% success rate chance per transfer(with PGS) based on how easy I get pregnant.  I guess they were right!

books,3,0,3,"&gt;The great oak tree had stood on a hill over the Hudson, in a lonely spot of the Taggert estate. Eddie Willers, aged seven, liked to come and look at that tree. It had stood there for hundreds of years, and he thought it would always stand there. Its roots clutched the hill like a fist with fingers stuck into the soil, and he thought if a giant were to seize it by the top, he would not be able to uproot it, but would swing the hill and the whole of the earth with it, like a ball at the end of a string. He felt safe in the oak tree's presence; it was a thing that nothing could change or threaten; it was his greatest symbol of strength. 

&gt;One night, lightning struck the oak tree. Eddie saw it the next morning. It lay broken in half, and he looked into its trunk as into the mouth of a black tunnel. The trunk was only an empty shell; its heart had rotted away long ago; there was nothing inside - just a thin gray dust that was being dispersed by the whim of the faintest wind. The living power had gone, and the shape of it left had not been able to stand without it.

politics,11,0,11,"To be fair, while they both are goons for billionaires currently it does not mean they are the same. Believe me, I'm disappointed and saddened by what Obama has done, but did my vote not matter? It definitely mattered. Imagine if Romney was president, things would definitely be different. The federal government would likely be cracking down harder on drugs than Obama, the US would likely be more involved militarily worldwide, no healthcare change, and there'd likely be major further tax cuts on the rich. Obama could be just a start of things going slightly left/liberal again, it could go further if people MAKE it go further.

Also, the reason that the candidates suck in the first place, that this happens, is BECAUSE people don't go vote. Imagine if everyone in who was pro-legalization got out to their primaries and got out to their elections and voted, it'd be legal quickly, but none of those people do. They all say ""the establishment doesn't want it"" while candidates who are campaigning for it cant get any votes. Florida is a great example: medical legalization *was on the fucking ballot* and guess what? No young people voted and it failed. This was something they could have directly changed without ANY representative interference, a direct people vote, and it failed because ""my vote doesn't matter"".

The problem is the people who are ""disenchanted"" do nothing to change things and don't even vote (the very bear minimum) and then complain things aren't different. Things won't be different unless you do something! And keep doing something! No candidates you like? Go campaign next time, tell everyone you know about it, donate money, vote in primaries, vote in local elections, etc. etc. 

It's hard for me to see understand the people sitting on their hands yelling Hillary and [insert right wing] are the same when none of do them  *anything at all* to change that. 

And things don't always change quick. Sometimes you have to work to make things better that may not come to fruition for years. 

So go vote at the very least. At the worst you can do the ""lesser of two evils"", at best you can begin a shifting towards the people you DO want in office, if not now, then at least later.",t3_35219j,cr0kztw,t1_cr0ihkq,t1_cr0kztw

SkincareAddiction,2,0,2,"Well, I can't really give a specific answer to that. It took me around a year to get to that routine, with some products along the way working great and staying.... and some leading to terrible setbacks.

My old routine was heavy bp cleanser, sa spot treatment, and sa moisturizer. My skin was always red, irritated, flaky, and my acne was terrible. Just switching to a gentle cleanser and moisturizer (neither of which I currently use now) made huge strides in improving the quality of my non acne skin, and also dropped my pimples down by half. That probably took two weeks or so. After that, things have been added in one at a time over the span of a year, things have been changed out and gone back to, etc. 

So.... idk. As long as a product doesn't break me out, I usually stick with it for about 4-6 weeks to see if I see improvement. Most of the time I can see it sooner than that, but sometimes not.

So overall deserved outcome, but Bayern still had a better game as I expected.

space,1,0,1,"Human intelligence isn't the issue, **this isn't an engineering problem**, it is a physics problem.   And the physics governing macroscopic objects traveling through space **is completely understood.**

If you have any understanding of the physics I challenge you to work the numbers.  You can use anti-matter for your propulsion at 100% efficiency.  I think the nearest candidate system is 26LY out.

What you will find is that it would take the entire energy output of the planet working for many years to launch a single suicide mission to the nearest candidate star. That you cannot store enough energy to actually make it work.  It is likely that the people on such a mission would die of radiation poisoning in the first couple of years.

[I think the science fiction write Charles Stross put it best](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2007/06/the_high_frontier_redux.html) in his blog noting that the physics simply is not in our favor.

Double from event, 100%extra from scroll or elite.

Where to level? Teratoday has a good guide, do essensia quests they are really grindy and you can mob up big amounts so you kill once or twice each quest.
There is a spot filled with fast respawning wolves too, you can grind there till 42 or even 44.

44(46 without priest buffs or help)-58 is a breeze at devan mobs, unless its as freaking overcrowded as right now so take your time untill all the gunner gimps went through and have a much better time if your on a pvp server.

How to level this fast? Grinding mobs ignoring measely quest rewards is a lot faster then shitty quests.

Finally, like always, focussing on it and preparing for it. They bought items they will need before the release and grind 100%of the time now so they advance fast while you are new, don´t know where to go and didnt google a leveling guide (not so clever).",t3_355lzv,cr17z7h,t3_355lzv,t1_cr17z7h
GamerGhazi,4,0,4,"The most egregious as far as I'm concerned is Odin activating the Destroyer armor just to retrieve Mjolnir.

Now, don't get me wrong, Marvel-Odin generally waffles between being a huge jerk and being a somewhat benevolent father figure, but the one bit of consistent characterization is that he's never been cruel to people who are worthy of Mjolnir. Hell, when *Loki* briefly became worthy of the hammer (during the Axis storyline), he congratulated *him*, too.

And yet just because this particular Thor happens to have boobs he goes absolutely ballistic and tries to use the most powerful weapon in Asgard's arsenal to kill her.

And it depends on what you mean by 'better'. If you like the empowerment story of the new Thor, both Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel are excellent, well-written stories about that. If you want the Norse mythology feel, I'd recommend Loki: Agent of Asgard, which is basically a series about Loki trying to be on the side of the good guys for once.

If you want to build something that fits in with the general character of the neighborhood, I think you can make a good case. If you want to create something that is going to be perceived as an eyesore, or, say you're trying to do something that raises your property value in a way that is perceived to give you an unfair advantage as compared to your neighbors, that's more likely to be shot down. 

If you want to do more research without spending any dough, first, get a copy of the zoning code and read everything that pertains to your property. Very good idea if you have insomnia. You want to do enough highlighting or whatever, that if someone in the zoning office or on the board tells you something that is not in the zoning code, you want to be able to point to page X and say, sorry but you think that's not correct. 

Then attend one of their meetings. See what kind of cases they hear and what their demeanor is. 

The next thing I'd do is see if you can have the lot split without having building plans drawn up. It can either be legally split, or not. That might cost you the price of a survey. 

Can you post an aerial shot perhaps? If your father's property is 50X200 and the neighbors are all 50X100, then, sounds like a slam dunk to me. But perhaps it's not that simple. 

I used to do some work in an area of ""horse properties"" where lots were either one or two acres. In the 1970s, some people bought the 2-acre lots and put a house right in the center (making a lot split impossible). I would occasionally get calls from people who thought their house and 2-acres of land should be worth exactly twice as much as people with a house and 1-acre. So not all land is equal, is my point.

&gt;i saw it on the internet so it must be false


There are mountains of scientific studies that confirm this. /r/DarkEnlightenment, the next step for Red Pillers, acknowledge and and accept this. Race realism is real, and to blindly dismiss it as ""stuff on the internet"" is equal to being a SJW.



1) The preponderance of evidence demonstrates that in intelligence, brain size, and other life-history variables, East Asians average a higher IQ and larger brain than Europeans who average a higher IQ and larger brain than Africans. Further, these group differences are 50-80% heritable. These are facts, not opinions and science must be governed by data. There is no place for the ""moralistic fallacy"" that reality must conform to our social, political, or ethical desires.

Source: [James Watson's most inconvenient truth: race realism and the moralistic fallacy.
](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18656315)

2) ""The Asian sub-sample averaged a higher IQ (110) at age 7 than did the white (102) or the black sub-samples (90).""

Source: [Cranial size and IQ in Asian Americans from birth to age seven](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289697900040?showall%3Dtrue%26via%3Dihub
)

3) Whites on average have a 15 point higher IQ than blacks, across many different studies.

&amp;amp;gt; ""There is a long-standing 15 point or 1 standard deviation difference between the intelligence test scores of African Americans and White Americans, though it might have narrowed slightly in the then recent years. The difference was largest on those tests, verbal or non-verbal, that best represented the general intelligence factor (g).""

4) IQ across different ethnic groups in the US: Blacks have an average IQ of 85, whites of 103, Asians 106 and Jewish Americans 113:

&amp;amp;gt;The study found that the average IQ for African Americans was lower than those for Latino, White, Asian, and Jewish Americans (85, 89, 103, 106, and 113, respectively; Herrnstein &amp;amp;amp; Murray, 1994, pp. 273–278)

Source: [University of California and University of Western Ontario](http://psychology.uwo.ca/faculty/rushtonpdfs/pppl1.pdf)

5) Overall, 18% of Asians have an IQ over 120, 10% of whites do and only 1% of blacks. Nearly 84% of blacks have an IQ below 100, which is slightly below the average IQ for whites. [The ratio of white Americans to black Americans who have an IQ over 125 is 30:1.](http://i.imgur.com/AmwfD29.png) 

&amp;amp;gt;The IQ gap between blacks and whites in the United States—15-17 points—has not changed since it was first measured nearly a century ago. Both races’ test scores rose during the century, but the gap remained as large at the end of the century as at the beginning despite considerable social change.

[Source: University of Delaware](http://www.udel.edu/educ/gottfredson/reprints/2004socialconsequences.pdf)

6) For those who claim that IQ tests are biased against blacks and that's why they keep getting lower scores, there are IQ tests like the [Raven's Progressive Matrices](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices) which don't have any language and rely entirely on visual pattern recognition. It's simply finding patterns in visual shapes. Even then there is a marked difference between black and white IQ scores, not only in America but internationally as well, like in Africa between white and black engineering students:

7) Harvard psychologists took a look at how black children adopted by well off upper-middle class white families at a very young age perform on IQ tests once they grow up in white families with good socioeconomic conditions.  Black children adopted by white parents average 89 on IQ tests at age 17 (slightly better than the 85 average for blacks nationally). White children who grew up in the same households and had white biological parents on average scored 109. Even with the same socioeconomic upbringing, the racial IQ gap remains.

&amp;amp;gt;The Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study examined the IQ test scores of 130 black or interracial children adopted by advantaged white families. The aim of the study was to determine the contribution of environmental and genetic factors to the poor performance of black children on IQ tests as compared to white children. The studies' general findings were that the IQs of children of a particular race did not differ significantly depending on whether they were raised by their biological parents or by adoptive parents of a different race. The gap between black and white IQ scores remained even if growing up in the same family.

8) East Asian countries have on average the highest IQ scores. African countries have on average the lowest. European countries are generally between the Asian and African countries.

Source: http://www.statisticbrain.com/countries-with-the-highest-lowest-average-iq/

9) Blacks performs substantially worse in standard school tests than whites.

&amp;amp;gt; From the higher education achievement perspective: In 2012, the mean critical reading SAT score for college accepted students was 428 for blacks and 527 for whites. For mathematics, it was 428 for blacks and 536 for whites. For writing it was 417 for blacks and 515 for whites. 

[Source: US Department of Education](http://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=171)

10) From the elementary education achievement perspective: At both the grade 4 and grade 8 level, there is a persistent achievement gap between whites and blacks in both mathematics test scores and reading test scores in ALL states. 

[Source: 2007 US Department of Education National Education Assessment](http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pdf/studies/2009495.pdf)

11) For those looking to pin the lower IQ scores of blacks on socioeconomic factors, IQ is largely genetically determined:

&amp;amp;gt; Estimates in the academic research of the heritability of IQ have varied from below 0.5 to a high of 0.8. (where 1.0 indicates that monozygotic twins have no variance in IQ and 0 indicates that their IQs are completely uncorrelated) Various studies have found the heritability of IQ to be between 0.7 and 0.8 in adults and 0.45 in childhood in the United States.[6][9][18]

I turned off the traction control and put it in the highest power setting for my commute home yesterday and my commute to school today. Honestly, it didn't feel significantly different. I did multiple max acceleration trials (still only going up to 6k RPM) and it was still uneventful aside from having to go through the gears very quickly. The acceleration was noticeably faster, but in terms of skill needed to handle it, nothing that a rider with any amount of experience can't manage. The traction control being off did come into play on two separate occasions when I was at a lean and accelerating quickly which caused my rear tire to slip a bit. In both occasions, by  the time I felt the slipping it had really already corrected itself, so not something I'd worry about unless you have very panicky reactions.

Now while I understand the hurt you felt but what happened before you became exclusive is out of bounds.  If he “cheats” on you while you are exclusive then I agree you have a trust issue.
The alcohol and drug issue may correct itself.  Sometimes it is an age thing that becomes less of a priority with age.  
How he answered your BJ question:  kind of a shitty response however what did you ask him verbatim?  The reason I ask is because how you asked could have bearing on how he answered your question.     
Having been two different guys’ “secret” I kind of agree with him on the being “public,” however I would have killed him for using the term “bae.”

canada,2,0,2,"For Canadians like me who are worried about the Liberals' support for this, Joyce Murray (Vancouver-Quadra) spoke as to why the Liberals ended up supporting the flawed bill - it's actually a good read. There's also a Liberal - NDP exchange that is worth going over as well. It alleviates a lot of my concerns.

https://openparliament.ca/debates/2015/5/5/joyce-murray-2/

A brief summary with the key points I saw:

""Before I get into that, though, I do want to say that this bill is a signature strategy of the Conservative government and the Prime Minister. That strategy is to package some positive elements of public policy together with some negative elements of public policy in one bill for political and partisan reasons. The reason would be to make an effort to divide the progressive vote.

[...]

This bill, Bill C-51, is part of that long lineage of the shamelessly bad public policy on the part of the Conservative government in order to pursue partisan objectives. The Liberals are voting for this bill because of the positive elements, and we have laid out our amendments, representing our concern about the undermining of charter rights and freedoms and privacy in Bill C-51.

[...]

While the Conservatives may inflate the true risks to members of our society here in Canada based on the instances of the terrorist attacks last fall, there have been some real changes to the threats to Canadians, and the Liberals accept that. We acknowledge that, and we want to see security improved to reflect that.

[...]

It used to be that a terrorist threat was more like the one that occurred on 9/11, with an organized attempt to create damage here in our country. That is still a threat that we need to guard against. In addition, the use of social media and the kinds of campaigns to radicalize young people that are being conducted by Daesh, or ISIS, are new channels for terrorist activities and threats. Therefore, it is reasonable and appropriate, and I would say it is necessary, for the government to respond and to reduce access to those channels

[...]

The kinds of provisions that would be brought in by this bill include provisions which, had they been in place last fall, could well have saved the life of Warrant Officer Patrice Vincent. [...] [S]hould someone die as a result of an incident that could have been prevented by improving security, that is something that can never be undone. That is one reason we believe that this bill should go forward.

[...]

What many citizens are not aware of is that the government did approve a number of amendments in response to issues raised by the public and by the Liberal Party of Canada. The government removed the word “lawful” from before the words “advocacy and protest” so that legitimate forms of demonstration are not captured by this legislation. It amended this bill to limit and clarify the minister's intervention powers over Canadian airlines. Furthermore, the government clarified in law that CSIS is not a police agency and has no power of arrest.

[...]

The current government has not adequately legislated transparency and accountability measures into this bill. The Liberal Party is committed to making those improvements. We are committed to providing national security oversight, not just for CSIS but for the collection of government agencies and departments that have security and intelligence responsibilities.

[...]

I am pleased to say that it was a Liberal initiative to strengthen privacy and rights in a private member's bill. That was my private member's bill, Bill C-622. I invite anyone following this debate to go to my website and find the material on Bill C-622.

[...]

The Liberal Party is the only party committed to both strengthening security provisions as needed, as the world changes around us, and protecting and enhancing privacy and charter rights of Canadians""",t3_355yn6,cr21a9b,t3_355yn6,t1_cr21a9b

DnD,2,0,2,"Monks and Wizards are not all that bad a combo because you're not giving up your Martial Arts features as a multi Wizard without armor and a shield.

That being said, you are only ever going to be able to cast a single 6th level Spell slot and it will take you until Monk 8/Wizard 11 (level 19) to get there.    And you're also giving up being able to cast the upper tier Wizard Spells AND the upper tier Monk Ki Elemental Attacks (11th &amp; 17th) though admittedly, you'd be able to cast those same spells with a lower level Wizard.  But the point stands: you're not going to be able to shake the pillars of heaven with either class because of dipping.

Depending on which is higher (WIS, CHA or INT), if it were me, I'd just stay Monk/4 Elements and take Magic Initiate Feat at your level 8 threhold; choose 2 Cantrips and one 1st Level Spell as a Daily Power from the elemental magic from the EE Players Companion to compliment your elemental build.

If your WIS is high, Druid.  If your CHA is high, Sor/lock.  If your INT is high, Wizard.  

This is just mechanics and number crunching, of course.  If you want a Monk/Wiz multi because dammit, that's who your character is, then do exactly that. ",t3_3592d9,cr27cuf,t3_3592d9,t1_cr27cuf

Het is sowieso niets waard als het niet fatsoenlijk onderbouwd is, maar dat is een tweede. Onderdeel zijn van een democratie betekend dat je rekening houdt met anderen. Je mag een mening uiten, maar niet zomaar naar eigen goeddunken. Het is simpel en logisch. Als jij iedereen gaat lopen beledigen en afzeiken, vloekend en tierend, dan gaat dat exact tegen democratie in. Waar tolerantie voor andermans meningen evenzo belangrijk is.

ffxiv,2,0,2,"Chocobos are unlocked as part of the main story, but indirectly. When you reach the part that you join a Grand Company, you can then buy a 'chocobo whistle' for 2000 Grand Company Seals (acquired by FATEs, hunting logs, Guildhests and levequests mainly), and get your chocobo. In fact, even if you had a mount from other means (Veteran Rewards, Collector Editions...) you wouldn't be able to use it until you've completed the quest to get your issued chocobo.

Transpose is just something automatic for me. Fire until you run out of MP, Transpose, Blizzard until you have recovered enough. Then you can either wait for Transpose again (slower) or start using Fire again to cancel out the Umbral Ice effect. That's how it was at low levels at least, later you get other means more efficient to recover MP.

Melees have 'combos' and 'positional', where they deal more damage from the side or rear. Archer is mobile artillery, they can move while shooting arrows, unlike any other class. Thaumaturge moving interrupts their spellcasting compared.

But both THM and ARC don't have much positionals, which makes it simpler. They also have no combo to follow, they have 'priorities' instead. For example, THM getting Firestarter or Thundercloud, MP management... ARC is Straight Shot, Poisonous Bite, Wind Bite, and then Heavy Shot spam until something else happen (Bloodletter, Straighter Shot proc, Straight Shot buff runs out...)

Priority means that you don't simply follow a rotation like combo attacks do (Fast Blade -&gt; Savage Blade -&gt; Rage of Halone...), you simply use what's more approriate at the time, like managing DOTs or using procs when they are up.",t3_35ai01,cr2k2su,t1_cr2jqyl,t1_cr2k2su

During my service I really did some work on my knees, and often after a long work week they can be painful to stand on. So during one of these 'honor' sessions I elected to stay seated. Which apparently caught the ire of some fan who promptly screamed at me about how everyone should support the troops.  

To that, I agree. All I could think however is standing and clapping wasn't supporting anything. It was next to doing nothing. That dude, the reason he stood and clapped and made a show was for himself. Nothing more. 

EDIT: I just want to be clear, after reading some comments below. I'm not judging people for participating in these scenarios, nor am I judging those who thank us. That is not what I meant. For the most part people are doing it because they feel it is the right thing to do, and I completely understand that. The problem is it has become watered down due to the fact it happens at every game. It's gotten to the point where some people feel ""well, I did my part"". People are not obligated to do anything more. This is your right as an American, and why the people you're honoring are doing what they are doing. 

I once was a part of Fleet Week in NYC as a riot control demonstrator just months before 9/11. We were given tickets to many sporting events and I have been on the side of the one being honored. It was definitely a cool experience. But it was a different world. It happened more organically that it does today. Or maybe it didn't and subjectively I felt it did.

I only took issue with the guy who screamed at me, knowing nothing about me. Some people only do it for themselves, and that's the problem. ",t3_35a95e,cr2lpnd,t1_cr2ii8p,t1_cr2lpnd

AskReddit,2192,0,2192,"When I was 16 two friends and I stole 23 garden gnomes from one street, 16 from one house and the rest just across the road, it also included a little elfish house and a pretty hefty stone toadstool. Mainly because we were kids, it was 2000 in a small town in England and we had Fuck. All. To do.



We set them up on my friends downstairs coffee table, put the table directly in front of the living room door so that when his mum got up for work she would properly shit herself. Screams happened, things were said, and grounding was the conclusion.


Anyways, several weeks later I am over my friend’s house and his mum tells him in no uncertain terms to get rid of them, or at least some of them as they were, and I quote ""a pain in the arse"". So being a good son he agrees, and being a good friend he comes up with a scheme.



An hour or two later there we are, backpacks full with 'war damaged' gnomes (beaten with hammers and covered in fake blood, even made one of them a little sling and another had a 'cast' on it's leg) and a note from the leader of The United Gnome Nation. This note went on to explain that the gnomes from this street were called up for a war against the Evil Gnome Empire and in order to protect the realm they had to leave. It accounted for the 'lost gnomes' and for their absence and the note was littered with four lettered swear words (we were 16 and cool as shit). We drop them off in front the owners’ garden gate, leave the note propped up against the 'leader' and go about our lives as if nothing had ever happened.



A week later, a friend comes over with a local newspaper... The Wokingham Times. Front Page and centre... we see the article. 'Seeing red a pranksters' gnome joke'... It was gnome joke when sick pranksters returned a woman’s stolen ornaments to her garden covered in fake blood...


That’s right; I got to front page with a gnome prank before reddit even existed!

AskReddit,3504,0,3504,"When I was 10, I rescued this 3 mo. puppy from a shelter. I was a pretty shy kid and I basically did everything with this puppy, she was my best friend. A few years later my parents divorced. I decided to live with my father and shortly after the divorce, he began to see this younger woman who didn't like dogs. They eventually married and one day I came home from school and my puppy was gone, my dad had gotten rid of her to fulfill his new wifes wishes. I was heartbroken. Fast forward four years later, my junior year of high school, my grandmother gets this call from a shelter who says, ""we found your dog"". Despite being completely confused and perplexed as to what they were talking about, my grandma went to the shelter to see what they were talking about and it turned out to be my baby girl. we had chipped her thankfully. even though 4 years had passed, it didn't matter, I had gotten her back again and wasn't going to let anything come in the way. Now 22 and 5 years later from getting her back, my almost 13 yo. puppy is still with me. http://imgur.com/a/cYg5J (first pic is when I got her back, other 6 are since)

* Hey everyone, so a lot of people have been asking how my dad and I are now - we are okay now, it's still a major wound between us, but we've worked through it. he's apologized and acknowledged what he's done and that's what really matters to me in the end because of how much it effected me as a kid. it will always hurt me when I think about it but those are years I can never get back so i try to be understanding/positive about the situation (more so then maybe I should) despite what he did even though it wrecked me. (he is a pretty big jerk tho if I'm honest with myself so all the name calling is pretty appropriate in the end, SlicedBananas pretty much nailed it from the beginning. i just try to be the better person)
* A lot of people have also been asking if my dog recognized me - I think so! My grandmother and I went to go pick her up from the shelter together and when I opened her cage, she ran straight to me and seemed to press into my chest, from then on I just assumed she had! It was a very nerve-wrecking experience, I was so nervous that she wouldn't recognize me. 
* Also, nope! I still don't know what happened to her during those 4 years. Apparently my dad had initially given her to my aunt who arranged for a friend to give her to another friend type of thing, but I really don't know. At this point, and given the state she was in when I got her back, it's probably best it remains a mystery. She was in really bad physical condition and she had a lot of emotional scarring (she was deathly afraid of men), both of which took months to rehabilitate.

He also may be forming an emotional connection with her that is out of line, and he knows it.

Everything about this movie looks horrible. The CGI looks worse. I don't know how you can fail to make the special effects look less convincing than T2, which was 24 years ago btw, but Genisys managed to do it. 

The marketing has been so stupid it's insulting. I had no idea it would get worse than the first promo pictures from Entertainment Magazine, but then came that STUPID Game of Thrones Mother of the Resistance promo. Then there's the heavy spoilers in the trailer, the PG-13 rating, Jai Courtney, I don't know where it ends.

If you have no interest in this movie or you dislike what you see so far, I beseech you not to go see it.

nfl,-2,0,-2,"No surprise. While there is no direct evidence implicating Tom Brady in the deflation of footballs already approved by the ref during pre-game inspection, there was still strong evidence he knew JM (contradicting his earlier statements), and at some point told JJ and JM to have the footballs inflated to 12.5psi (again, also inconsistent with earlier statements).

There is little doubt that JM, and probably JJ, conspired, with or without Brady, to deflate the footballs after inspection, despite both of their consistent attempts to contradict the most obvious interpretations of the texts between the 2 of them.

As a result, and in light of the report's scientific investigation regarding pressure levels in footballs with respect to time and environment, we can be reasonably sure that Patriots personnel deliberately cheated by deflating footballs they knew should have already been inflated to 12.5psi by the refs. Is it possible JJ and JM wanted to be cautious and be certain that the refs didn't fuck up (like they had prior during the Jet's game when some footballs had been inflated close to 16psi) and wanted to quickly adjust the footballs to the 12.5psi range before the game? Yes. Is that legal? No.

Is it likely JJ and JM would have taken such extreme steps without Brady being aware of their activities? The report thinks it is more probable, than not, that he was aware. Did he want underinflated footballs? No one knows, but it is more probable than not that Brady was aware of the actions of JJ and JM regarding actions taken after the ref's inspection.

In this I think the Patriot's organization, specifically JJ and especially JM, is a lot more at fault than Brady, but since it is more probable than not that Brady was aware of the lengths JJ and JM were going to get those balls to be 12.5psi (or lower) after inspection, then the league has all they need to justify a suspension. However, is it possible Brady is completely innocent? Yes, but the league's decision is not bound by the higher standard of reasonable doubt. They merely only have to reach 50.1% in order to avoid any potential successful civil litigation in the future.

How long that suspension will be is anyone's guess, but I can't see it being less than 3 games. Either the league punishes the Patriots HEAVILY (since their personnel most likely deliberately broke the rules in a malicious way) and give Brady the benefit of the doubt, or they punish Brady (and the organization less-so).

Honda,3,0,3,"This particular Prelude was owned by my best friend. It's the second Honda I ever drove and first Prelude I had ever been in. Ultimately, this car started my obsession with Honda and lead to my career choices working for a Honda dealer. 

The car itself has seen better days. My friend, who I consider my brother, bought this beauty in 2004 and had about 89k miles on it. She was basically bone stock. Now she boasts an impressive list of modifications, including a 5-lug conversion, Legend GS brakes, Tein SS coilovers, and an onslaught of JDM parts. There's too much to list. 

About 6 years ago the stock H23 overheated and cracked the head. A replacement head was fitted, but sooner after a tick turned into a knock and she was parked. He purchased his older brother's 92 Prelude with an H22A swap for a steal to swap into the 94. Eventually he decided to build a completely new H22A for the 94. 

Six years later and she's yet to move under her own power. She's moved from garage, to storage, to garage, slowly getting worked on, but never reaching a running state. 

I transported the vehicle from Arkansas to Kentucky past weekend. I have an assembled H22A, with Type S pistons, Bisimoto rods, Toga HV oil pump, manual tensioner, and balance shaft delete. The head is a stock H22A head. Transmission is a stock M2B4 (OEM JDM LSD). 

My plans are to get her running by the end of the summer. The drivetrain needs installed, new fuel lines need to be run, and wiring needs to be sorted out. I'll enjoy driving her for the remainder of the warm months, before she goes under the knife.  Most of the rubber components needed on this car are discontinued, so a lot of fabrication will have to happen. The interior needs reupholstered, the body needs repainted, but luckily no rust. 

Overall I'm very excited to own this car. This is my third Prelude, my other two being a 93 Si and 96 VTEC. ",t3_35d394,cr3alhp,t3_35d394,t1_cr3alhp

Fair enough. I didn't see the polls and like to give benefit of doubt. If people want to go to Rupert Murdoch for voting advice, that's up to them...

&gt;Generally, the left is against nationalism for reasons of doctrine.

There were two nationalist campaigns running concurrently during the referendum run-up. The British Nationalists, and the Scottish Nationalists. What's the difference?

&gt;SNP has tried to sell its civic brand but I don't hear many takers.

I do. It was practically the whole theme of the referendum campaign. The only people who thought it wasn't were those down south who weren't getting the social media messages, but only the biased mainstream media coverage.

What kind of non-civic nationalism has as one of its largest levers, the fear that immigration would be curtailed? What kind of non-civic Scottish nationalism would have a London-born Indian as it's loudest voice at rallies?

It was about a political divide between the English electorate and the Scottish electorate, and pretty much nothing else. We don't want austerity, they do. We don't want nukes, they do. We don't want Tory governments, they do.

It doesn't mean we hate the English, but that's how it was painted. I'm English myself (well, I ""feel"" more British than English).

I was a mild supporter at first, but it was this video that clinched it for me.

For the past 2-3 years, their entire international history is to choke. It's not like they don't show up and lose by 2-3K, they get stomped in embarrassing fashion. **Every. Single. Time**

But then IEM happened and people think TSM magically became some international juggernaut in one go? It doesn't work that way. TSM now thanks to all this pressure that is thrown onto them HAD to show up for MSI. Think of how much pressure that puts on you? And of course under pressure, they did what they always do: choke. At IEM, expectations weren't what they are for MSI so they got to surprise people. It was spontaneous and unexpected, amazing even.

At MSI, people expected them to finish top 1-3. Nobody expected Fnatic to do anything significant at the tournament. So what pressure does Fnatic have? If you win, you're gods who upset the ""top"" teams. If you lose, well everybody saw it coming and nobody will spite or hate you for it. For TSM, that first loss against Fnatic just ruined them.

Long story short: TSM choked. Bjergsen played the most bitch-made champs possible, Santorin did his best Warwick jungle cosplay and farmed for 20 minutes. Then when he left his jungle his team was 0-10. Lustboy looked 100% off his game, suicided a few times deep warding with no vision or knowledge. Santorin spend five minutes trying to dive Alistar + Urgot lane. Just terrible play. And even Loco choked, a lot of games 'felt' over at picks and bans. 

TL;DR: FreeSM choked like they always do. Nothing is new. No, this is not Thoorin's secret account.

I have a lot going on this weekend but I will get it cleaned up next week. Maybe I am the minority but I like darker themes. Maybe some coloring suggestions that makes everything darker still? I might have to make the theme switchable at some point. The colors now are the Blue 500, 700 from Google's color palette with Red A200 for accent.


So it looks like a lot of things are spacing issues. For the color picker I was looking at something more like this https://android-arsenal.com/details/1/91

BEHOLD! Saber at her strongest ever in the 5th Holy Grail War! (With cute ponytail to boot! She should stay in that ponytail!)

Well, *sort of* strongest. According to Official Type-Moon Servant Stats:

[Master - Fate Zero](/s ""Kiritsugu"")  

Strength - B

Endurance - A

Agility - A

Mana - A

Luck - D

Noble Phantasm - A++

**Master - Shirou**

Strength - B

Endurance - C

Agility - C

Mana - B

Luck - B

Noble Phantasm - C

**Master - Rin**

Strength - A

Endurance - B

Agility - B

Mana - A

Luck - A+

Noble Phantasm - A++

In short, she just received a massive upgrade from when Shirou was her Master, nearly on par with her stats in the 4th War. Though she has less Endurance and Agility compared to her days in the 4th War, she more than makes up for it with a boost in Luck [Fate Zero](/s ""Mainly due to Kiritsugu holding her back, while Rin gives her much more freedom."")

1. Created password protected rushwallet
2. Got tired of typing in password... rather than generating a new wallet, he just decided to use his encrypted wallet as an unencrypted wallet as well by removing the encryption flag and using the ciphertext as his entropy input (aka brainwallet)
3. Posted his wallet from #1 online thinking he was safe due to password being strong. Completely forgot about wallet #2 being exposed by this. Maybe he forgot he even had any money in #2.
4. This thread's OP stole his coins.

Do you like where you're at now? If not, what don't you like about it? Do you wish you worked for a company with better life balance, or do you wish you had better retirement benefits, or do you wish you worked for a company with more interesting projects? Figure out what you want to look different, and then pursue that. It may not be so much of a promotion as a lateral move.

If you really just want to make more money, you need to sort out a proper way to get there, and it may involve switching fields or starting your own business (maybe as a consultant or a landlord, or w/e).

All I can say is- if you feel like you are stalling it's because you're not learning. You don't need a promotion to keep a momentum, you just need to keep improving yourself and your position.

AskEngineers,1,0,1,"Not really sure what you are trying to say. Few questions:

What do you mean by putting the rotary tool sideways? I am not following there.  

The point of a gear cutting tool is to get the gear geometry correct. Typically there is a cutter for each type of gear (for example, if you want to make a 20 tooth gear with a certain pitch, you use one tool, if you want to make a 30 tooth gear with the same pitch, you use a different tool). There are [TONS of variations of these tools](http://ashgear.com/images/snglegrpa.jpg), and you typically need the specific one for the type of gear you are making. 

In other words, they are not universal. They do, however, create the correct geometry for that type of gear. Without the right geometry, your gears will likely not mesh well at all. The geometry for regular, well meshing gears is actually quite complicated and is a bit of a bitch to manually draw (on a CAD program for example). That is why there are usually gear generators in most CAD programs. 

What I recommend for your use is [using this site](http://woodgears.ca/gear_cutting/template.html), printing them out, and trying to cut them to the right size. Should work pretty well. ",t3_35hg62,cr4k79p,t1_cr4jbz0,t1_cr4k79p

How hard Cata raids are is pretty dependent on gear, with LFR gear you might want to do Cata raids on 25 normal instead of heroic, but I encourage you to try and see how far you can get.

Apparently people are also starting to solo bosses from Mogu'Shan Vaults (MoP), but these people are usually pretty well-geared and skilled.",t3_35i39s,cr4levi,t3_35i39s,t1_cr4levi

There are no technical limitations that make that type of meat a ""sacred cow"" that must be accepted to be able to get your diploma as a cook. I would also say you can have a career as a cook without pork. Danes eat *all sorts of meat* and have the highest consumption per capita of meat, so it's not like the person would necessary be forced into a life of working at halal-only places or vegan/vegetarian-only places. It's not an actual de facto problem. Also, there is a wave of health oriented consumption (those pesky sciency people) that focuses on eating meat less excessively and picking more healthy types (read: *not pig meat*). Finally, many interesting new concepts are opened by entrepreneur chefs who want to offer something different (a strength in a business that is very much based on consumption for the sake of variation). Why can't the person do that?

Your comment is a bit too black and white, and your comparison with Jews borders on insanity. All that I have mentioned above simply springs out of realistic reflection about the job.

Then a little voice in the back of my head said, ""Nah bro you can get higher,"" to which I complied. I smoked some of the loose shit at the bottom of my stash container. 

I don't know what it was about that last little bit, but being a fairly inexperienced ent I got FUCKED up. I was sitting in my room just smiling out my window for who knows how long. Then voices in my head began to talk to me to which I verbally answered them. I began pacing around my room and talking to the voices in my head. I started to freak out so I thought a shower would help.

I got into my bathroom and got down to my birthday suit. There i am standing there naked and just looking at myself in the mirror. I then told my mirror self that I did not have time to talk to him because i needed to take a shower. This went on for about 5 minutes. I then got into the shower, and the last thing I saw was my face before closing the shower curtain. I then got incredibly sad and saying ""I should have done something. I will never see him again"" for another 5 minutes.

I then began to tend to normal shower duties, and as I began scrubbing down my nether region, the voice in my head told me to RIP MY DICK OFF. I then stood there for about 10 minutes in the shower gripping my dick, arguing, and getting actually angry with the voice telling it that I was not going to rip my dick off.

Now that I am a more experienced ent, I'm not sure what was in that weed (it was from a dispensary) but all I know is that it got me rip my own dick off high, which I assume is probably a [12]",t3_35j8cy,cr54czz,t3_35j8cy,t1_cr54czz

Doubly unfortunate is the fact that it's not just about the military industrial complex anymore. The health of the USD is intricately woven into our foreign policy of war. New dollars are created every day at prolific rates, keeping interest rates artificially low and stock markets artificially high. The only reason this does not result in massive inflation is the *velocity* of the currency. As long as the dollar is in high demand and constantly changing hands all over the world, the inflationary effects of money creation is mostly mitigated. One of the major ways this happens is through the oil trade and the petrodollar. Imagine if the world stopped trading oil in dollars. Demand for dollars would fall, and could very well kickstart a runaway inflationary collapse. At the very least, interest rates would jump much higher than they are today. This would hit taxpayers doubly hard as it would affect their personal debt financing, as well as U.S. Government debt financing.",t3_35l5o9,cr5grdh,t1_cr5f8qe,t1_cr5grdh

Also, we make money on parts. It is part of the business model. So when a customer insists on bringing in their own parts we charge a higher labor rate to make up for that. So it ends up not saving them any money really.

The only time we wouldn't do that would be for performance or hard to find parts that we don't source.

Planetside,88,0,88,"Think it has less to do with the ""cool mechanics"" and more to do with weapon strength in the most common situation, being close to close-mid range.

Example being: At close to close-mid range, Orion is top performing; there's no real reason (beyond style points,) to use another weapon.

Betelgeuse is a flat upgrade to the Orion on live servers (not in competitive play, where a forward grip is more important) because of the heat mechanic.

But for that same situation, NC run Anchor, TR run CARV or MSW-R.

+ If GODSAW was the GOD-Anchor, it'd likely see more use.
+ If the Butcher wasn't a CARV with less accuracy (which means the effective range starts overlapping with the MSW-R which is more suited to the role,) it'd likely see more use.

That's the gist of it, at least from my perspective.

This is a 6 part series, each one over 15 minutes long if the 1st is an indicator... in total, that's as long as most feature-length movies, and all about men's issues.  If this doesn't indicate a desire to help men rather than ""making them virtual slaves"", just what would it take?  Or are you predisposed to believe conservatives would never support men at all?  

You say you like Bill Whittle and PJ Media... so do I, and I **don't** believe they are hardcore gynocentrists that want to enslave men.  Conservatives have a different take on issues than the left, and the real ones believe in true equal opportunity for all as being most important.  Many also believe in chivalry and good manners, which may include some kindnesses toward women like opening the door for them, but most would also hold a door open for a man too.  It's simply being nice to a fellow human being, it's not ""virtual slavery"", and it's entirely optional.  The laws must state equal opportunity for all, and helping others and showing them kindness is a value instilled socially, typically by your own family, never enforced by law or meant to remove your inherent freedoms.  It's the left that tries to legislate ""helping women"" with unequal laws and preferential treatment under the law, not conservatives.  We believe in legislated equal opportunity, and then encouraged (and **100% optional**) kindness and help for others.  The fact that we don't want to legally enforce that help is why conservatives are called ""cruel and heartless"" by many on the left.",t3_35ktxf,cr5kd42,t1_cr5c7ud,t1_cr5kd42

pcmasterrace,1,0,1,"&gt; I don't see a problem with it. Just because I prefer PCs does not mean I can't own a console. I own many in fact, and I'm shameless about it.

Never said you can't.

&gt; This was always a problem, and said practices have been practiced regardless of platform. The Valve everyone worships is guilty of this too, ie. not allowing refunds on steam, use of DRM etc.

1) Of course it was always a problem but before when specialization was needed consoles were a necessary evil and exclusives helped at the very least spur competition of a kind. Now? They have no benefit to the consumer.

2) Not regardless of platform. Sony/MS/Nintendo in particular hire developers and pay out to compaies for the strict purpose of making console-seeling exclusives. PC is not owned by any one company, and thus this practice does not exist on PC at all. PC exclusives happen for completely different reasons that are far more understandable than being bought or paid to lock a game or certain content down a platform.

3) Yes, Steam does participate in poor consumer policies. Steam is also not PC. Steam is one single providers that has existed as a behemoth of PC gaming for a mere fraction of PC gamings history and already there is wear and tear in support for Steam, as their should be. A smart PC gamer makes purchases on GOG, Origin, straight through the developer, or by actually buying a physical copy. And soon MS is coming into the mix with a (hopefully far superior to GFWL) online retailer of their own.

See, that's the problem. If you play on a Playstation, you play by Sony's rules. Period. This is not the case for PC, and Steam's current monopoly on too many titles is gravely unfortuante but nowhere near the control of Sony/MS/Nintendo and their respective consoles.

TL;DR Sony IS Playstation. Nintendo IS Wii. Microsoft IS Xbox. No one company, however, is PC. We're all PC.

&gt; You act like there's no PC exclusives. Plenty of new and refreshing PC games coming out, especially by indie developers. Also the fact I've spent far more on PC games compared to console games - console games are generally more expensive so I have much less of them. Doesn't mean I can't enjoy the odd console exclusive or two either.

1) Yes, as I touched upon earlier, PC certainly has exclusives, but they have them for understandable reasons- either the developers budget is too small to get on console (the initial fee for getting on a console is astronomical, and headway for indie titles on consoles is nowhere near as prominent as it is on PC), OR the game simply CANNOT work on consoles.

These two factors, obviously, are not present for console exclusives. Consoles titles are easier to port, are cheap to port, and there is no title that would work on a console but not a PC. Console exclusives exist because Sony/MS/Nintendo pay for those exclusives to exist, nothing more.

&gt; I love PCs for their modularity, but I'm not fussed that consoles are locked down. I don't buy consoles for that, I buy them for the games.

You might not be fussed but by purchasing non-modular technology you're providing economic incentive to continue that way. Is a future where most if not all technology is non-modular a future you want?

&gt; I am fully aware of dodgy company practices and in fact all of them practice it to some degree these days, the matter is finding the lesser of evils. With that in mind, I don't buy games like COD or anything that is dumbed down/bloated with pay2win DLC.

Exactly why PC modularity is mroe important than ever. Consoles have no internal competition. If you don't like what Sony does, tough titties turkleton. Your gaming experienced, in its totality, is OWNED by them, not you. 

But on PC, we can use our wallets to support or defy bad practices since there's multiple companies and projects butting heads in nearly every aspect of the PC. Steam w/ Linux and Vulkan vs Microsoft w/ Windows and DX12, Origin vs Steam, AMD vs Nvidia, Intel vs AMD, Corsiar vs Coolermaster; we have options, and while some are certainly under threat and we suffer the consequences of that situation, we have never been in a situation where we are forced to comply with a company's decisions to stay on PC.

&gt; Buying shitty rehashed games like COD does, not necessarily the fucking console.

By buying consoles you support future exclusives for consoles existing for no other reason than they were bought for by Sony/MS/Nintendo.",t3_35jdx1,cr5koni,t1_cr5juq6,t1_cr5koni

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_X71ZduRifA&amp;spfreload=10

1) I think the best defensive is a good offensive with thresh, with maxing e, your auto attacks do a lot of damage, and its very hard to trade autos with thresh, even with just auto attacking. There are many ways to be offensive without q or e, such as standing in an unwarded bot bush; this creates pressure because they don't know where you are and what you are doing, then either ward it (now they can't ward river before 1st back) or facecheck it.

2) This depends on elo. From silver to diamond, people develop the idea of dodging by turning back for 1 second, especially for thresh. My best advice is to see how they react when you try to q, if they dodge, then maybe next time you aim where they will dodge to (madlife prediction). As a general rule, if they don't know you are gonna hook (like from an unwarded bush) then no need to predict because they can't dodge what they don't see.",t3_35jt9u,cr5oxnf,t1_cr5oigd,t1_cr5oxnf

apple,-37,0,-37,"**I'm a BIG APPLE FAN** ... as many regular readers in this sub will know...

&amp;&amp;

This is great news - for NOW - 

**but it raises several questions:**

* Will the Chinese state _allow_ a foreign company to dominate its market into the future?

**Answer**: **No**.

Explanation: If you think that's an absurd question - clue up on how the US has strategically engineered dominance in the global/Western app/web market - from search to social networks - via companies like [IQT](http://www.iqt.org) and others that have seed-funded Google to Facebook.

The Chinese have more lately been doing the same, which is a large reason why Google couldn't get traction there. Xiaomi has caused friction with party members to guarantee its quick growth - but don't doubt for a moment that once it 'proves itself' (popularity) that it won't be backed by the Chinese state to have a competitive advantage over Apple and one that Apple can't challenge in the market or _any_ court.

* Depending on your view of geo-politics and 'where the world is going' - there's a potentially worse option - 

Apple, with most of its profit 'stored' outside the US, will redistribute its 'human capital' part of operations _outside_ the US _once_ the US - or just before - it loses currency/monetary hegemony ie the Yuan becomes the global currency (personally - I don't see the Yuan becoming so, but rather an 'intervention' preventing this).

This is partly predicated on a BRIC bank forcing an entirely new currency to take over from the US dollar - while potentially devaluing listed US companies and giving BRIC tech firms new markets to overtake US ones.

* Depending on your view of humanities desire for freedom you'll agree or not with the possibility that there will be a 'capitalist revolution' in China - forcing the birth of democracy and the 'death of the Party', allowing foreign capital to grow uninhibited.

To many, this would appear to be the second most likely option - not the third/last - but, it would appear - ironically with help from US companies, the Chinese State has built an unparalleled surveillance system that allows it to incaricerate at will - over a QUARTER MILLION EX-PARTY **KILLED**, **DISAPPEARED**, or SCARED into SILENCE within the last 2-3 YEARS and 'ethically cleanse' **millions** of 'non-Chinese' up to and during this time.

If you think it's crazy that companies like Cisco have helped the Chinese build such a surveillance state, 'Google' IBM being hired by the NAZI party to help the find/catalogue Jews/dissidents to the origins of [Fanta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fanta) in NAZI Germany - made and sold by the Coca Cola company.

The same process is happening NOW - but in a much slower 'war' - one for a new global/world order.    

So ... as much as this news may appear 'great news' for 'free markets' - remember ... China is yet to become 'free' ... and EVERY financial WIN Apple makes in China is at a cost you and I can barely IMAGINE.

For the first time in history(?), the US - the world's 'champion of the free' is indebted greatly, perhaps **beyond repayment**(?) (without 'intervention') to a country with the opposite politico-economic ideology.

And Apple will only be able to expand internally in China until it has allowed the Chinese companies like Xiaomi to not only copy them as much as needed to extinguish them.

Personally, I hope Tim continues to bring more manufacturing and IP back to the US while continuing to grow sales in Asia, to try to balance the scales. But a lot is going to depend on the diplomatic relations of the US in bringing/keeping India etc on-side. Without them, China is several times larger than the US eg its largest carrier having over 700M customers. No matter what you think about the supposed 'corporate greed' motivations for the TPP - the primary one is to keep US hegemony. I'm not excusing it, but it's obviously a last desperate act to retain US hegemony without an 'intervention'.

So no matter what 'global business prof's' think - and as great news as it is that Apple's high product standards are winning in a foreign market - clue up on the context they are in, because we are in for 'interesting times'.

**Edit**: You can vote this down all you want - but it won't change reality - at some point soon the US will either create an 'intervention' to regain economic sovereignty or its economy will be subsumed by the Chinese (as it appears the US is in no position to economically challenge China), and Apple's success in China will possibly be a tipping point. When Nixon ditched the Gold Standard (which many say got us into the current deficit), he said, ""We are all Keynesians now,"" ... Will a future president say, ""We are all Communists/Socialists now""?? (Look at the trend of Western states reducing/preventing 'sovereign debt' by treating citizens as 'assets'/'debt(or')s ... eg private prisons, reducing privacy, etc ... and ask yourself if this process hasn't started already?!?)",t3_35orxy,cr6fi9d,t3_35orxy,t1_cr6fi9d

His supports, venge and lion, also tried to rotate, but they weren't *as* successful as the enemy supports. They at least guaranteed a return kill on the SF once, but otherwise their rotations did mostly nothing. 

Black's safelane Jug started to call out and flame the supports because he's a ""competitive person"" as you describe. Black tells they to calm down, things aren't that bad, etc. Enemy team starts pushing T2s, starts diving T2s, Radiant takes a good teamfight, turn it around.

At the end of the game Jug asks Black if he can add him. Black says he didn't like Jug's ""blame game"" and he'll let the supports decide if he should add Jug. They of course declined.

Don't forget, the autonomous system is far more than just GPS. 

Speed sensors keep tracking even if signal is lost (like many modern cars now have). Even if a GPS fix is lost, if you have the last position and an accurate log of distance and direction traveled, it's not hard to figure out where you are now.

Cameras and radar (and LIDAR-thanks /u/PangoriaFallstar) are constantly checking around you to react to the real-life traffic and pedestrians that GPS can't help with. GPS isn't what keeps it in a lane or on a road, it's the various sensors. GPS is mostly used for location/routing.

EDIT: For those looking for more, check out this [article/video](http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/artificial-intelligence/how-google-self-driving-car-works), which goes very deep into how the system works on a technical level, and even shows a great visualization of what the car ""sees"".

Imagine someone had enough data points on you to analyze and predict which qualities you find most attractive (even if you yourself are not consciously aware of them) to near perfect accuracy, and then pack ALL of them into one person.  Of course that person is going to stick in your thoughts.  Of course you're going to have a hard time letting go of the fantasy.  And on top of that, think of how difficult it's going to be when every other real person will fall short of that ""perfect"" fantasy.

The best analogy I can think of is drug addiction.  Minuet is like heroin; so overstimulating, it literally resets your expectations of pleasure.  Normal things no longer give you the same ""high"", and never will, ever again (heroin: not even once).  The Bynars are like a dealer who slips a free sample in your drink, and then skips town forever.

photography,1,0,1,"What do you mean everything is incorrect? same with film iso it only has one speed, sensitivity.

Changing ISO only changes how the data from the sensor are digitized.
Back in the days you could push and pull the film, and we are doing the same with digital. 
Incorrect information of how sensors work is causing confusion among photographers, leading to poor decision in photographic exposure, especially in extreme conditions, like night and low light photography.  

I am not saying you should only shoot at iso 100 but when you are doing more extreme iso settings you are better of under exposing and then bring back the images on your computer. You have the same amount of light at iso 100 and 200 with aperture and shutter setting.

Plus, /r/hireawriter allows clients to post for dirt cheap prices, whereas /r/writersforhire, or as the sub is named hireaProwriter, it requires at least .08/word and experienced, professional freelance writers who have a good-sized portfolio.

Right now, with only key doors and one key per room, the easiest way to really explore the dungeon is to just go in a straight line because unless you have a minimap, you don't know what's coming no matter what, and trying to branch off at any point just makes it harder on you when you try to find the entrance again.

there are not millions and millions of people working in GCHQ. There are a very finite amount of people who will be working on this, i would be surprised if the number is above the tens, rather than the hundreds. Therefore, not everyone's comms WILL BE LOOKED AT.

They will use all sorts of tech to identify and predict who is being naughty and who is being nice, and then will focus on the naughty ones, so if you talk about bombs and killing the Queen and setting fire to army bases then, yes. you probably will get monitored, but if however, you like the majority of people talk about the latest Game of Thrones of how you neighbour keeps leaving his bin out when he shouldnt then you wont get looked it.

When we draw Mohammad it is saying you are less than human in much the same sense you think nigger says that to blacks. It is saying not only do we think you should adopt our ideals by force, but we are also going to belittle and disrespect your religion, because it is a religion of less-than-human barbarians.  Because of the US relationship with Islamic nations, it is more than insulting their religion. Its not enough we try and conquer them but we look into their holy book for things that we can do to specifically offend them. Not saying that all Muslims are peachy keen, but if you think their hate for us is just about religion you are wrong. We stripped everything from them except their religion, then we insult that. They are using their religion as cover and justification for more base offenses the west has committed against them. Its about groups of people who have been wronged on such a fundamental, base level and are reacting to that and using religion as justification for the terrible acts they preform on their enemies.

I like that he talks about how there is a cap to muscle gain. It's not as simple as ""more food and protein = more muscle"". There is a point where you've reached a limit, and any extra calories are stored as fat. He also goes into how starting from a low bodyfat percentage. can help with muscle gains, and how it has large impact on how the end result is perceived.  

*[rant]* I feel that a lot of people here fail to think about this, when critiquing people's progress posts. I've been involved in, and I've seen, quite a few heated conversations where someone is claiming that some beginner gained 30 lbs in 16 weeks, and majority of that weight is muscle. It's just not possible, yet this person claims that said beginner isn't fat, after having bulked, therefore insist they're right.  
If person A and person B both gain the same amount of muscle and fat, over the same amount of time, but person A started at an underweight 8% bodyfat and person B started at a more average 15% bodyfat, who's results will look better, in the end? No doubt, it would be person A, as he had more room to gain fat, thus final bodyfat percentage would be lower than person B's, and his muscle gains are going to show better. Person B had the same exact results, but the end product doesn't show it as well. This scenario often leads to people saying person A gained unrealistic amounts of muscle, and person B was shoddy with their bulk...  *[/rant]*

relationships,5,0,5,"yikes.

you aren't going to like this, but i'm kind of on his side.  i expected, based on your subject, some sort of tale that swirled around name-calling, abusive behaviors, and the like.

instead i got a story about you, at 2 in the morning, giving him the impression that you required him to wake up and console you over this traumatic event, which i'm guessing he's done many, many times.  make no mistake, i completely understand how you feel, and i can see why, if you were already upset, his rejection of your snuggling would set you off.

i'm just suggesting you see this from his perspective.  he's been holding your hand through this crisis for two months, you crawl into bed in the middle of the night and tell him you're feeling sad about it again (which he's probably by this time accustomed to needing to stop what he's doing and console you), and so his instinctive - half asleep - reaction was to grow frustrated and lash out.

his yelling at you, especially if it's a habit, is NOT okay.  but you do sound a bit like someone who is emotionally needy, and as such, becoming draining.  i'm not saying you're wrong, because you AREN'T.  i guess all i'm doing is attempting to offer possible perspective on why he reacted the way he did.  further, the things he said to you the next morning indicate he does, indeed, feel drained by your obvious habit of making him responsible for your emotional wellbeing.  first, you needing snuggles.  then, you feeling sad about your trauma.  then, you crying yourself to sleep without ""so much as a hug"" from him.  and so on and so on.  based on this, and what he said the next morning, i'm guessing you do this often, and not just as it pertains to your trauma.  i'm guessing that he feels like his primary role is to coddle your feelings (about anything and everything, even the carpool lane - not just this), and to hell with his own.

i wish he'd just let you snuggle him, or at least softened when you told him why you wanted to.  but i'm guessing history is why he didn't.

something to think about.

and you probably owe him an apology too.  he owes you one, but as he said, i think you owe him one as well.

sorry.

Using a low flush vs a high flush saves min. 1.9 gallons of water/flush. 

Let's say every one is flushing 3 time per day, and there are 37 million people in California. 

That means 84 million gallons of water is wasted **per day** in California alone, because of high flush toilets. This equals 30 billion gallons per year wasted for *nothing*. And people complain about Nestle?

AskReddit,58,0,58,"I've been living by myself for about 5 years and I almost never throw away food. I just buy whatever is on sale at the grocery store and eat it over the next 3-4 days. Try to get ingredients that can be used in different ways so that you're not just eating the same thing every day. For example, you can buy some nearly expired chicken for dirt cheap and just poach it all real quick (use the oven, it has better temperature control than the range). It would have gone bad in 1 or 2 days, but cooking it kills most of the bacteria so it'll stay good for about a week. You can make 100 different meals out of poached chicken, a sauce, and some kind of starch. My favorite is chicken, rice, and tarragon vinaigrette, which also works pretty well with canned tuna. An old school classic is a cream sauce made with mushrooms and sherry or vermouth, which could be called chicken a la king or chicken tetrazzini depending on where you're from. I always use dry vermouth because I keep it on hand for martinis, but you need to be careful with it because vermouth can easily be overpowering.

It's also a good idea to learn how to make an omelette. If you have something leftover that isn't enough for a full meal just put it in an omelette and make some rice to go with it. A spoonful of Cuban black beans in an omelette is insanely delicious, and it's a very inexpensive meal. I always use 3 eggs per omelette because it fits perfectly in a 12"" pan, but any time you're cooking eggs there's a little trial and error involved as you learn the stove.",t3_35uw44,cr8pmfs,t1_cr8mjr9,t1_cr8pmfs

As my most tactical firearm, I have been working on bolting every accessory I can find on to the gun.  The brass catcher was typically really hard to find and it took me a year to track one down and it was not compatible with my old style side rail.  Luckily RTGparts has started importing B&amp;T parts so I was able to get the new style rail.  They also have the brass catcher so no one will have to put in the work I had to find one.  The new rail comes with zero hardware and requires some mildly creative McMaster-Carr surfing to find what you need.  If anyone needs some 4-40 3/8” weld nuts I now have 98 I don’t need. 


The B&amp;T catcher is well made, light weight, holds 4 mags worth of brass (120 cases), and has positive opening and closing points.  The Velcro bottom makes emptying the ~~evidence~~ brass a simple task.

In other news I’ve found the MFT React short grip is one of the few vert grips I’ve found that allow (is thin enough) the stock to fold all the way.  It also fits the light weight theme of the TP9 at only 2oz.  I wish it was a little shorter for this gun so I might chop it down if I get bored. 

Also the B&amp;T mag couplers don't work with the TP9,  I didn't really think about it when I ordered it but you can't really use the grip anymore.  The couplers are meant for the APC9 or the resurrected B&amp;T ~~Tec-9~~ the P26 (what's dead may never die)

Android,6,0,6,"Won't the part of this technology that allows the phone to work with magnetic stripe readers soon be rendered obsolete in the US?  All payment readers will have to support either chip or NFC.  You can't use a chipped card without inserting the card into the reader.  If the reader detects a card that is supposed to have a chip (and that information is encoded on the mag strip), it won't proceed with the transaction unless the card is slid into the chip reader. 

Edit: from LoopPay's FAQ:
&gt; Yes. You can add chip cards to your LoopPay account today and use them at mag stripe readers (MSR) just like any other payment card. However, if the merchant POS terminal is configured to accept EMV cards, you will be instructed to use the physical card to make the transaction via the chip and PIN card reader. LoopPay will soon be announcing a solution that will address this inconvenience. 

So, once all the EMV readers are turned on this year, you'll need your card anyways.

Elsewhere on their site:
&gt; Most if not all EMV terminals also include a standard mag stripe reader (MSR). Because of that, any standard mag stripe card that is loaded into a LoopPay device can be transmitted, read and processed through that standard reader. Consumers can also store their chip cards in LoopPay devices today and use them at any terminal with an MSR where EMV is not active. EMV card track data contains service code 201 which prevents those cards from being read by the standard mag stripe reader when an EMV reader is present and active. So chip cards cannot be transmitted to the MSR on an EMV terminal. At some point, issuers may issue to LoopPay users dynamic cards with service code 101 to make these cards work at any terminal (EMV or mag stripe only terminals).

I doubt card issuers will be eager to give folks less secure cards, since they will be picking up all of the liability for fraud:

&gt; The good news is that MST is considered a card present mag stripe transaction with the associated rates with no required changes by any party. When liability shifts in Oct 2015 in the U.S., there are three basic scenarios:

* If the issuer is issuing a dynamic track via LoopPay, the risk is effectively gone so liability shift is moot for that card.

* If the issuer issues a 201 chip card that is self-provisioned by consumer and MST transmits into a mag-only terminal, then the merchants bears the risk.

* If the issuer issues a static 101 track data transmitted by MST, into either an EMV or magnetic-only terminal, the issuer bears the risk.",t3_35xwvv,cr8zgni,t3_35xwvv,t1_cr8zgni

AskReddit,187,0,187,"Ok, I'm going to throw this out there and see.  A year ago, I kind of lost my appetite,  always felt nervous,  a kind of tightness in my chest.  I got super worried and went to the doctor.  They took an EKG and said it looked mostly normal but said I should go to the ER.  I did and they didn't even look at me and admitted me immediately for overnight observation.  The next day, I finally saw another doctor that said I was probably ok, went of on some tanget about my cholesterol.  Wound up with a 'scrip for that that I quit taking after a month or so.  So I went home with a $6000 hospital bill. (after insurance, yay Merica) 

To this day I still feel the same, tired a lot but my sleep schedule is ok, I eat enough to keep myself going but it's a chore.  I've always been skinny, 5'9"" 130#, and it's wasn't unusual for me to not eat for a day every couple months for as long as I can remember.  Apparently my body likes to fast every once in a while.  My weight hasn't changed, I just have to almost force myself to eat.  Nothing is appetizing.  I just want to feel normal again and enjoy food.

washingtondc,7,0,7,"I just did this same trip back from NYC last night. 

As others have mentioned, they've closed all of the lines between Philly and NYC, including NJ Transit. When I rearranged my travel home yesterday evening with the help of an Amtrak representative, she mistakenly advised me to take NJ Transit the whole way to Philly which was not happening. Athough NJ Transit and SEPTA are all honoring Amtrak tickets, they don't have any idea as to the actual way the schedules/train times are working.

What I ended up doing was the following and I can only assume it can work going the opposite direction. 

Took NJ Transit from NY Penn Station to Trenton Transit Center. At Trenton, they have shuttle buses set up to take folks to the West Trenton station to board the SEPTA train to Philadelphia. The West Trenton station is really not much of a station at all but there were several SEPTA employees on hand to let us know when the next train would be arriving and where to go to wait for it. There are no ticket sales at this station so you will either need to have a valid SEPTA ticket or Amtrak ticket. I then took SEPTA all the way to 30th Street Station in Philly and was able to take an Amtrak from Philly to DC.

Time wise it took 5-6 hours and broke down like this:
- NY Penn to Trenton Transit Center - 45 minutes
- Shuttle from Trenton Transit Center to West Trenton - 20 minutes
- Waited at West Trenton for about an hour for the next train however they were still getting their shit together and might have this wait time down) - 60 minutes
- SEPTA from West Trenton to 30th Street Station - 50 minutes
- Amtrak from Philly to DC - 2 hours

Opposite direction, I'd recommend buying an Amtrak from DC to Philly, then getting yourself to Trenton either via cab as someone suggested, or taking the West Trenton line to the end of the line, then shuttling to Trenton Transit Center and boarding a NJ Transit train to NY Penn. After much frantic research yesterday afternoon, this to me seemed like the best non-bus option. 

I do think there has been a lot of frantic ""what the eff do we do"" amongst the other rail providers in the area, and only see the wait times getting better (very optimistic over here, ha).

Hope that helps and let me know if you have any additional questions!

Randy Orton. Randy Orton is a third generation superstar, capable of getting absurd heat or ridiculous crowd pops, has a very impressive title history as well as knowledge of how to orchestrate a match and perform certain moves so flawlessly. His powerslam is one of pure perfection, [example](http://dailywrestlingnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Reigns-Orton-SummerSlam-gifs-001_001.gif) and is someone whose matured oer the years and evolved with the business. He's had his issues sure, but he's seemingly learned and matured from them showing he's capable of being a star for the foreseeable future. 


John Cena, now I know everyone is tired of ""Lolcenawins"" type scenarios, but in terms of who is the best, cena is surely a contender. He has been there day in and day out, taken the crowds punishment and chants and turned them into memorable moments, has not really (from my knowledge) ever injured someone critically indicating he's a pretty safe worker,and has given kids someone to really look up too that from my knowledge is generally a really good person. He puts on entertaining matches week in and week out, sure he makes mistakes and has a very *simple* to learn move set, but my god man that guy has literally done it all. He is the Hulk Hogan of this generation. 

I'd honestly throw in Lesnar too. Lesnar has matured, seemingly grown physically more muscular over the years, learned an array of moves from submission to power, been involved with or had matches with some of the most iconic names in Sports Entertainment. And will always be considered a legitimate threat to anyone who has his shiny belt. ",t3_35xuem,cr971yy,t1_cr8z840,t1_cr971yy

vegan,10,0,10,"&gt; So if the majority of people moved towards Fruit/vegetable/vegan diets and lifestyles. How much space would we need?

I don't have the math done but theoretically, if we sustained ourselves off of plants without raising animals, we would need less space for farming than we currently use. The reasoning behind this is that we need to grow a huge amount of plants to feed the animals. We could be eating those calories directly instead of feeding them to an animal. *It is more calorically efficient to eat lower on the food chain.*

Going to skip 2.

&gt; Is locally grown food as bad to you?

Locally grown food is no better or worse for your health than non-local. Less use of pesticides/herbicides is healthier for you. Again, I don't have figures to support, but locally grown food is often not as resource efficient than conventionally grown food. Conventional methods are built for max efficiency. It costs less resources per calorie including transportation. (Please someone correct me if you know any different)

&gt;I do like meat though and was wondering if anyone ever moves towards a 90/10 diet.

Here most people will tell you that 90/10 is much better than a standard diet, but we are generally strongly opposed to exploiting animals even a little bit. Local has nothing to do with humane treatment and taking a cow's life is immoral regardless of how local it is or how humanely it was raised. Farm animals must be slaughtered in their adolescence for farmers to profit. In other words, the animals' interests are ignored.

Glad that you are taking more interest in your food. I see often that people are extremely hesitant (especially men) to admit that they care about the animals themselves rather than the environment or their health. I encourage you to explore the morality and ethics of killing for your nutrition.

Asking someone to do something they don't want. 

Then they do it after asking more than once. 

That is a crime in your world.

One has to do with women being the victim, the other has to do with men. 

That's what you meant to say.

&gt;Don't make other people do things they don't want to, why is this a hard concept? 


Like by kidnapping them. Kidnapping is wrong. You agree surely? So if you ask someone to go somewhere and they aren't 110% excited about it you have committed the act of kidnapping. 

Which is a felony. 



Do you agree or are you pro-human-trafficking?

Plus, the ability to scythe down enemy AI while saving your own  translated well to multiplayer, where AI kills counted against each sides tickets.

AskReddit,5409,0,5409,"When my first wife was 4 months pregnant she was diagnosed with Stage 3/4 breast cancer, at 18 weeks the doctor gave her a few choices. Her best chance of survival was to abort the baby and have aggressive chemo, we talked about it, and she decided to try and carry our Son to term. They delivered our son healthy about 6 weeks early, she died about 5 months after he was born.  I have since remarried and he is now almost 18. I don't plan on telling him that she saved him at her expense. It was a tough time and I don't blame him,  and never have. 

Edit: Thanks for the gold, my First, I have been a lurker for a few years but felt the need to tell my story, now standing in central London , tears streaming, anyway we are all happy and well adjusted now, I will think long and hard about how to tell him the truth. Thanks for all the nice words.

Edit 2 - I'm overwhelmed by the comments and advice, I've been in London in meetings all morning, and I have been useless at my job today. I just wanted to address a few things here.
After her mastectomy, and a lengthy biopsy she was found to have an extremely aggressive type of breast cancer, in fact we later found out it had spread considerably, the treatment would have been in vain, even If we had aborted, her life expectancy would probably have been less than 2 years. We made the choice to keep him before we knew this, invasive treatments and MRI / multiple X-rays would have put some risk on my son, so we took a choice.  He knows she died of Cancer, and he knows it was soon after he was born, but not the details,  he never knew his mum, he does not grieve for her, it's cold, but true.  She has written to him, a number of letters , the first of which he gets at 18, the next at 21 and the final one when he gets married. They are sealed and private, I have no wish to open them, but it remains possible that she will detail what happened, although I think its unlikely, as before she died she made me promise protect him from the pain of her illness and decision.

PipeTobacco,0,0,0,"Personally, although it is harder in many respects to learn on aromatics they're the only way I was ever going to make any progress in this hobby because I absolutely had to have the benefit of their smelling nice to keep me interested at all. I initially tried all kinds of tobacco but the only ones that gave me any pleasure were the aros, even though they left a lot to be desired given my poor technique, etc. The pleasant aroma was what made me want to smoke them. I couldn't discipline myself to learn on something that gave me no pleasure. 

It was that way with guitar. I am now an accomplished guitarist and composer of guitar music but when I started out, my father, who was a music teacher, wanted me to learn ""the right way"" by going through lessons in a music book. I was bored to tears and gave it up. He left the guitar in my room and later, I started plucking away at it on my own. I started making chords that sounded nice to me and then started putting compatible chords together and then writing whole songs. Working from something that gave me pleasure allowed me to eventually develop my skills and knowledge. That's just the way I am and I've had to learn to work with what I have. Some people like learning things the hard way, lol!

One thing you *can* say about learning how to smoke aromatics is that you learn technique very quickly. They seem to be very unforgiving if you smoke too fast or pay no attention to tamping or moistness. In order to enjoy smoking aros you *have* to learn good technique sooner rather than later. I don't know for sure but it seems like non-aros are more forgiving. Possibly allowing a new smoker more time to entrench their bad habits?",t3_36266j,cra1zai,t1_cra0mbp,t1_cra1zai

For example, mastery may include having a fortress running at the literal peak efficiency or running so efficiently that there is literally nothing that can go wrong or taking the absolute least amount of time to build a self-sustaining fortress compared to everyone else who plays Dwarf Fortress.

Yes he does. He owes me the end of the story. He owes you the end of the story. He owes everyone that plunked down cash for *Book 1* a *Book X: The Epic Conclusion*.

He made a promise. How much weight you put on that promise is for you to decide, but to say ""welp he can just quit he doesn't owe us anything"" is plain bullshit. He has two houses, one that he uses as an office and library, goes on all these trips, has an HBO show, because he started telling a story with the promise that it would be seen through to a conclusion.

Everybody acts like writing a book is some kind of great sacrifice. It's not, it's a job, for which he is well paid. If you hired a carpenter to build you a house and he left the roof off because there's just no poetry in it anymore, would you move in anyway, pat him on the back, and tell him well done, go to your well earned rest? Would you agree with his insistence that the house is his sole vision and no one else can finish it?

We need to get off of all the extremes around here. It's not either/or. The people asking him if he's going to drop dead and making asses out of themselves are wrong. The people who fall all over themselves to say ""Oh, it's okay, he doesn't *have* to finish the story, it's not like he *owes* us anything because we bought a book, GRRM is not your bitch, Neil Gaiman said so!"" are also wrong.

**Edit: Thanks for the gold, stranger.**

*Following was not in original post*

It's hard to gauge tone on the Internet. Maybe this post sounds a lot angrier than I meant it to. I'm not angry, I'm passionate. Thanks to everybody that replied and all the discussion this post generated. This is a subjective issue and I get that people might feel differently than I do about this matter.

For me my investment in ASOIAF is more about whatever I paid for the books (even though I've bought lots of copies- Long-lost dog eared paperbacks of AGOT, ASOS, and ACOK and hardbacks of Feast and Dance, ebooks of all five, hardbacks of the first three, and more paperbacks to annotate and serve as reading copies, plus two copies of TWOIAF, one of which I keep wrapped, the other of which has soup on it). I was never talking about money here. I was talking about the mental and even spiritual investment all of us regular posters here have put into these books.

If you don't like my house analogy, ask yourself this: How would you feel if you bought a treasure map, and it led you on many great adventures and was a really good map, except you got to where the treasure was supposed to be in sight, to the island of the Aztec gold or the secret valley of the crescent moon or the shores of Avalon, and you turned your map around to find the rest of the way and it was just blank. Would you be mad about your unfinished map?

I love you all, even the guy that called me an asshole, because Jon is going to bang his zombie mother, and Rhaegar is Daenerys' dad.

Even in the lamentable, God-forbidden chance GRRM never finishes or doesn't make it to Book 11 or however many books there end up being, we will still have an ending. There will forever be an undiscovered country where Benjen exists in quantum superposition and Jon Snow's mothers meet up for tea and Wun Wun was behind it all. Martin's world has enriched our lives and for that we all owe him respect... and because we chose to listen to his story he owes us a good faith effort to bring us an ending. We can all be friends with each other, and him, and maintain this expectation. Because we need him to finish the story and he needs us to hear it. Not because he wouldn't get paid if we bought the books, but because without the readers there would be no one to hear the story and it would die once past his lips. Storytelling is more than a diversion, a pastime. It's fundamental to the human condition. It's what separates us from the rest of the natural world. It is itself something which is beyond words, and a way for us to grapple with aspects of the human condition that are also beyond words. We live and breathe stories. Authors need readers and readers need authors.

To everybody that thinks I'm mad: I'm not. To everybody that's mad: Chill out. It's just a book. You really should relax.",t3_362jmi,cra5wgv,t1_cra3f1p,t1_cra5wgv

Science Shows How Reddit Users Are Like Sheep

A new study shows that users on social news sites view a comment differently based on the judgement of users before them

http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/science-shows-how-reddit-users-are-like-sheep-26361635/?no-ist

&gt;    The project list includes a study of how activists with the Occupy movement used Twitter as well as a range of research on tracking internet memes and some about understanding how influence behaviour (liking, following, retweeting) happens on a range of popular social media platforms like Pinterest, Twitter, Kickstarter, Digg and Reddit.

I've reached the tipping point with my current job. Time to find a new one!

**Setup:** | Neat, INAO, rested 20 minutes.
**Color:** | Very deep amber. 
**Nose:**  | Caramel and chocolate-coated green apple. A really pleasant nose. *The sherry takes a few minutes to develop its nose, but once it does, it explodes like the sherry a-bomb that it is.* **26/30**
**Palate:** | The palate is much heavier than the nose indicated, and the sherry finish clearly comes through. The caramel and chocolate are in the background and let dried figs and prunes take center stage. *On the second tasting, I can notice a little more heat than the first time. I’m going to attribute this to the dryness of the sherry finish. It’s a quite challenging whisky – the balance of all the flavors and the dryness is something that needs a warm-up* **33/35**
**Finish:** | Moderate, with the dark dried fruits hanging on for a minute, actually a nice finish. *The second tasting results in a sherry finish that just keeps going. That flavor just won’t go away, and I only had a sip of the dram* **33/35** 
**Score:** | **92/100** 
**Value:** | **3/5** @ $150 for 750ml

&amp;nbsp;

Average score to date: 79.4

&amp;nbsp;

This is the first whisky to which I wholeheartedly ascribe the ‘sherry-bomb’ title! The first time around, I really didn’t expect it based on the nose, adding a little water after the first few sips really helped it open up. This one’s a challenge – you have to respect the dram to really enjoy it. Take your time. I’m glad I saved it for last pour of the night, because it wrecked my palate like a ghost pepper. I feel violated. It’s quite the experience, and I recommend it to all sherry lovers out there. Thanks again, /u/normallyimonimgur!

&amp;nbsp;

Would I rebuy a bottle? N/A – but yes if it were possible.

AskHistorians,453,0,453,"I'm currently finishing my Master's thesis about the ""War on Drugs"" so I'll be happy to give you my two cents. Although /u/KyleBridge refers to another thread covering the same question(s), that one focuses (among other things) on the paper industry. My own paper is more concerned about the overall chronology of the ""Drug War"", as well as its moral background. 

First of all it's necessary to remark that the Congress didn't prohibit cannabis per se in 1937. Rather, it delegated the responsibility for the *taxation* of cannabis in 1937, to the IRS. 


*""it [Marihuana Tax Act red.] technically did not make marijuana illegal; it simply placed a huge bureaucratic burden – with severe penalties for noncompliance – on anyone who wanted to sell or buy the drug.""* -Reznicek,2012.  


The literature concerning this topic attribute this factor to two aspects of the ""Drug War"". Firstly, by making the taxation and regulation vis a vis cannabis a question about revenue collection, the actors who supported prohibition and/or regulation of cannabis, were able to omit a discussion about state rights contra federal rights. By making the regulation a federal ""sized"" matter, they increased the scope of their agenda.  


*""By basing their efforts on the federal government’s constitutionally assigned revenue-collecting powers – that is, on the power of taxation – and on the regulation of interstate trade, proponents of antinarcotic legislation avoided the questions of individual states’ rights that were broached by any attempt at the direct control of drug sales and use.""* -Hickman 2007.

Secondly, prohibitionists felt that a taxation came across as a more ""neutral"" initiative, and in this regard ""sold"" the idea to the congress. 


Your question also implies the alcohol prohibition (18th Amendment) which ended four years earlier. This exact prohibition left several without a job in 1933 when (alcohol)prohibition ended,when that the substance they had sought to combat, once again became legal. In comes Harry Anslinger, who was also occupied with the alcohol prohibition earlier. -Bertram, 1996.  


Anslinger managed to ""spin"" the regulation of cannabis in a way, that it was mostly connected to minorities, primarily Mexican immigrants. The immigrants became ""persona(s) non grata"" since the Depression made them unwanted competitors; 


*”The consumption of marijuana, or cannabis, in the United States followed an influx of Mexican immigrants in the early twentieth century who were fleeing their country’s civil war. During the Great Depression, massive unemployment increased public resentment and fear of Mexican immigrants, escalating concerns about the problem of drugs.""* -Reznicek, 2012. 


It is also worth noting, that the ""Marihuana Tax Act"" 1937 was but one of the many chapters in the ""Drug War"" or ""War on Drugs"". From a legislative point of view, it expanded on an earlier act known as the ""Harrison Narcotics Tax Act"" from 1914. The Harrison law (named after a New York Senator) also taxed certain drugs. However, it was only concerned with heroin, cocaine, and opium.  


Hence the 1937 act addressed this by including cannabis as another substance to be taxed and regulated. This regulation did not mean a *de jure* criminalization, rather a *de facto* since it was not worth paying the taxes and deal with the ensuing bureaucracy.  


This is just a brief answer to your question, but I hope you made something out of it. If not, please let me know, and I'll go more into detail with various factors, particularly the ethnic and racial background for some of the regulation/taxation of the various laws. Now, I better finish my paper, he he.

CLG,4,0,4,"You should also include Scarra's thoughts here. He said some very interesting things about DL. It appears as though DL is a bit of a sociopath, lacking empathy. He also seems to lack the self awareness to realize he IS selfish and arrogant. He says he is willing to play whatever is necessary for the team and he has no say in draft. Yet, he refuses to play certain champions (Urgot that Link suggests, Caitlyn for the Syndra+Caitlyn insta burst combo). He says he works super hard and he is very motivated yet it seems clear from what Scarra says that he doesn't realize that how he feels is very different from what he does (perhaps intentionally, which would give credence to my view of him as a bit of a sociopath- because he is trying to manipulate his image in a very subtle way). Every split I hear Double claiming he is motivated and works super hard, that he is willing to put the team first and be a better team mate. Yet the results don't show. Double does not play a lot of soloQ- he has around 300 games combined this season (Peng Yiliang, Doublelift, Scorro). Most of the top 10 have more games on just that account.

Scarra's thoughts- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZYV-feVN098

Edit (something else I thought of)- the fact that he is such an asshole in the team environment (there is no way to deny it at this point, multiple sources have confirmed it) but such a silly and fun guy to watch in interviews kinda gives weight to the feeling that he does heavily manipulate his image, that he IS a manipulative 2faced individual. If there was a slight discrepancy it would be understandable- people will always try to look good in front of the camera, whether consciously or subconsciously. But he seems to have two polar opposite personalities. Just something to think about. ",t3_365835,craxvvt,t3_365835,t1_craxvvt

There was more to the Triads than meets the eye, and although they were useful to JC's cause, they weren't saints. Due to Hong Kong's position in the game, people were helpless and they regarded the Triads as their leaders and saviors, despite the obvious money extortion and other heinous crimes. Stockholm syndrome kind of thing.

The ""Aliens"" are but a genetic experience.

&gt;I also thought it was weird to be wielding and fighting with swords(and over a sword) in 2052(despite the fact that I used said sword myself

They actually explain its significance in the game, I think Tong does. A sword is not just a melee weapon for the Triads. It's a culture thing to cut your enemies instead of, you know, shooting at them with a firearm. So the nanosword with its crazy nanites is their ultimate weapon, both figuratively and literally.

&gt;Anyhow it was a very rewarding experience, I played lethal with my preferred weapons being the silenced pistol, the dragons tooth sword and the GEP gun(when I had space for it) and chose the Helios ending in the end.

Good choices all around. You ought to try a rifle build if you'll replay the game, rifles are particularly strong weapons, especially the assault rifle and sniper rifle.

I would enjoy the sword a lot more if it didn't occupy 4 inventory slots. Yeah, I know, game balance.

&gt;The story deals with issues about governance, public freedom and morality in relation to power a lot but I wish that like Human Revolution the game also dealt with the effect of augmentation on society and the individual. I felt like this was hardly discussed in the game and that was a bit of a let down

uncharged or midcharged SS catch most of my opponents off guard and kinda sort of give you a chance to run in but to be fair, WFT is more of a spam character than once that initiates approach. 

their moveset doesn't provide moves that cant be easily shield grabbed and punished so your best bet is spamming then reading.  (mix up your projectiles with their respective charge levels)

AFL,21,0,21,"Yes we have but it's kind of unavoidable. Theres a couple of main elements that I attribute it to. ""Fitness"" and forward structure. We've also had trouble getting clearances lately, but I attribute that largely to Wines' absence as he's been our contested ball beast for 2 years. Long analysis incoming.

I was saying this in another thread that Port have effectively had to lose a midfielder for the inclusion of Ryder. We were way too dependent on Lobbe rucking a whole game alone last year but we won our games from our sheer run power - this was accentuated by the number of midfielders we had playing. Look at the game where we overran Freo early last year, we subbed out our ruckman (Renouf that game) while Freo still had Zac Clarke and Aaron Sandliands playing. It was no wonder that we looked faster and everywhere compared to them, because we effectively had 2 extra midfielders playing at that point. This is what people are talking about when they talk about our ""fitness advantage"". We haven't been much if at all fitter, but we've had more midfielders playing which will naturally wear the opposition down until we're the only ones with anything in the tank. 

We have a new forward structure with Ryder. Normally you'd think that the inclusion of Ryder is a great thing for a forward line, except that hes a completely different style of forward from what we've had the past 2 years. Now we have 3 tall forwards (Westhoff, Schulz and either of Lobbe/Ryder resting forward) but none of them are real dominant forwards. The problem with this is that we're now predictable because we have to kick it to one of the 3 talls because there is not space in the forward 50 for our talls and smalls to work in. This is why its perceived as if we are bombing the ball into our 50m arc. The reality is that there is no space to hit up a short pass because our small forwards need to be in positions to crumb the talls now or the space that there is available is right near the boundary - see our shocking accuracy this year. Unfortunately our smalls are much better in space leading up than crumbing - so crumbing off the hands of our talls isn't effective either. If one of our forwards was a huge contested mark that could smash packs or handle a 2v1 then it would work in our favour but the reality is that any of our talls are even money to outmark the defenders.  

Personally I think that we should drop Westhoff (or even Ryder) in order to get rid of one of the talls so that we can find that space again. It's not an unresolvable problem for the team, but I don't think you'll ever see the same run and gun from port of last year for a full game again while we have Ryder in the team. 

TL;DR : We have 1 less midfielder and 1 more tall forward now compared to last year. We don't operate well with a tall forward line and we can't outrun teams without the extra midfielder. ",t3_3690zd,crbvbod,t3_3690zd,t1_crbvbod

CCW,1,0,1,"You are on point for the most part, except one: thickness. A 1911 being a single stack is less thick than a double stack Glock 19. To me it still does not offset the other disadvantages of a heavy, large, low capacity carry firearm. If caliber is important to someone, they can get a much more carry friendly XDS in 45 ACP. 

*Edit: Another advantage of a 1911 for carry is deterrence upon draw. 1911 looks a lot more menacing than, say a micro or compact, so you can get the attention of the bad guy pretty quickly. Again, not enough to offset other shortcomings, but a small plus for the 1911.

* It would cost $500 million, when similar arenas built at the time cost around $300 million (like the ones built in Charlotte, San Antonio, and Memphis).

* 100% public financing with not a single dime of private contribution, made all the harder since he was asking for Seattle public financing for a Renton arena.

* The plan was announced in February 2007, and Clay Bennett called off talks in April 2007 and announced the relocation to OKC.

I hesitate to say this but I think that the author leaves some things out here to cast a favourable light on their subjects.
I only have anecdotal experience and don't know how common a 'mom bonus' is but I think that there are obviously romantic relationships with most of these couples, the divorce rate is very low for the super rich. I also think it was a bit rich saying these women aren't independent, the majority of them are already rich before they meet their husbands, both having 'family money' and well paying jobs that they give up. 

I've known a few people in the younger versions of this type of social circle and they have been like a guide to how it works, it's fascinating; of course this is anecdotal, but the women could easily have independent and more egalitarian lives and marriages if they wanted,  but want that kind of life instead and I can see why from a certain point of view. Lots of people have told friends of mine that they won't consider a guy relationship material if he earns under x super high amount of money or doesn't have y job.  This seems like it's probably the result of the kind of 'winners and losers' extreme social stratification. 

The social stratification is part of it but those kind of jobs also heavily encourage a division of labour by having Japanese style work practices that select for loyalty and discretion etc at the top. The guys in this kind of situation have lives that almost totally revolve around their job, they mostly work super long hours  as a lawyer or in some kind of high banking or hedge fund type business and socialise at weekends in job related activities with people from their job, etc, etc.

With Iran engulfed in chaos, an opportunity for Iraq to annex the oil-rich Khuzestan Province materialized.[52]:261 In addition, Khuzestan's large ethnic Arab population would allow Saddam to pose as a liberator for Arabs from Persian rule.[52]:260 Fellow Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (despite being hostile to Iraq) encouraged Iraq to attack, as they feared that an Islamic revolution would take place within their own borders.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War#After_the_Iranian_Revolution)",t3_36aksf,crcl1tk,t1_crchoqg,t1_crcl1tk

Aliens can easily heal quickly to full hp so they can continue their harassing attacks, ESPECIALLY fades who just fly around the map at incredible speeds, heal fast, come back and kill you in one or two hits depending on the current upgrades you and the other team have.

Marines on the other hand can heal at an armory (and only while facing it so you can't actually fight while healing unlike the aliens) but to get armor back you need another player to use a welder on you. So you need a player to run around healing everyone instead of fighting the enemy, just to get them armor. Armor being very important for marines. Don't have armor? An onos WILL kill you in a single hit, and so will a fade.

You should also have a Strun Wraith now, which can easily support a status build and those scale well (and also don't really suffer from damage falloff).

I hear a properly built Drakgoon is also very powerful although I could never get to like how it handles.

AskReddit,157,0,157,"My mother was born in 1959. My mother has a very deep-seated hatred for and distrust of Japanese people, and it centers around Pearl Harbor. She knows that it is irrational. But there *must* be some reason for her to feel this way, right? Yeah. Because she was reincarnated from a person who died at Pearl Harbor. That's the only reason she can think of. To further back up her claims, she has a deep love for Patsy Cline and...1957 Chevys? I don't really know how that fits in.

Now, as to her distrust: She fervently believes that all of our electronics come from Japan and that one day, maybe the 100th anniversary of Pearl Harbor, all the Japanese electronics will explode, crippling the US in preparation for invasion. Because the Japanese are putting small bombs in every DVD player and computer.

This fantasy also extends to Middle Easterners. They are buying our gas stations so they can blow them up on the same day, maybe on September 11 some year, crippling the US in preparation for invasion.",t3_36cw3g,crdg0ck,t1_crcyi6o,t1_crdg0ck

- ""Man **not** on a Mission"" mentality. Don't treat every woman like you're trying to have sex with them. Don't have a mission for anything and just enjoy life.

Short Story Time

My friend, Steve, and I were driving through rural Alabama on a road trip. Steve was 6'3 and built and a total womanizer. He's always had some sort of girl attached to him and had a threesome his junior year of high school. The kind of guy that you befriend in hopes that you'll trickle down bang someone and end up liking because he's generally a cool dude.

That said... Steve and I stopped at a Cane's Chicken I believe and were the only ones there. We walk up to the register to order and a beautiful girl was working the cash register. I order first and sit in the area to wait for my food to come up while Steve orders. After his order, the girl looks at him and says, ""You have beautiful eyes."" 

Steve freezes for a second, fumbles around for his wallet, drops his credit card, says a voice cracking ""Thank you"" and doesn't make eye contact with her for like 10 seconds before awkwardly scurrying over to me. The girl at the till leaves to go back to the kitchen out of what I can only assume to be embarrassment.  I ask him what happened, hardly able to contain my laughter. 

Steve then proceeded to tell me that he had never received a compliment before, and had literally no idea how to respond. Steve had never received a compliment from a girl before, and it turned his legs to Jelly.

gunpolitics,-13,0,-13,"this is a good development, because it will likely see the SCOTUS.  it is appropriate that this question reach the highest court, since it appears to be no less than the other full half of 'keep and bear', for which Heller settled the former part.  

while establishment of an individual right was no small thing for Heller to accomplish, in terms of a *balance of the equities*, it also seemed quite a sensible result, all linguistic interpretations aside.  

the sensibility of a similar establishment for an individual right to 'bear', however, is by no means as obvious.  no right is absolute, and all rights have eventual boundaries after which they may properly be seen to intrude onto other rights.  in Heller, no such intrusion seemed apparent:  a gun which stays in the home poses no immediate, or even probable, risk to the general public.  

a gun which is carried out into the public sphere, however, is quite different:  arguments, misunderstandings, accidents, and conflicts of all manner, both foreseeable and not, can and do occur every day, and no one who ventures into the public can reasonably assure us that they are prepared for any eventuality. 

therefore, the claimed right of the individual to carry a gun in public is in balance with the right of the state to keep the peace and protect the public safety.  if left to their own devices, i believe that states and cities will by themselves answer this question in the best way for their particular place, culture, and circumstance.  perforce, if they are deprived of this discretion, such a result would inevitably mean that some places will be forced to allow activity which is clearly unsafe for their populations in the main.  

this is why i expect that, should the question of 'bear' reach the High Court, it will be determined that states do have the right to tightly restrict the carrying of guns in public as is currently the case.  ",t3_36g08f,crdtgdp,t3_36g08f,t1_crdtgdp

personalfinance,3250,0,3250,"A lot of well intentioned but somewhat incorrect advice.  Attorney here.  Mind you I only practice law in Ohio, so you can't take any of my advice as legal counsel.  However, state laws regarding assets tend to be similar from state to state.  Read the below, but know that some of it may be incorrect for your situation.  If money is an issue, you should check to see if a legal aid attorney in your area will represent you.  Or you can go to the probate court and see if they have volunteer attorneys who handle these matters.
1. it is true that you are not liable for any debts of your mother.  Your mother's estate will be liable for her debts.  Do not sign any paperwork that has anything regarding your financial liability.  Do not agree to undertake any of the costs of your mother's treatment.  
2.  Get yourself to a social security office and apply for benefits if your sister is still a minor.
3. Essentially the debts for your mother's hospital stay will be wiped in the estate.  It's too late to apply for COBRA benefits as someone else suggested.  See if the hospital has a financial ombudsman, but don't sign any paperwork unless you have an attorney review it first.  
3.Credit card companies, and many utilities have debt forgiveness programs, but unless you are a co-signor on any of your Mother's debts they can only collect against the assets of the Estate anyway. Also, these programs are run by particular departments/individuals within each organization, so the average customer service representative is just wasting your time.   
4. If you don't have access to funds to hire an attorney, you can try to probate the estate yourself.  There is a learning curve, but its not impossible, or for that matter particularly difficult.  The difficulty lies in not understanding the terminology and the process, not some secret law tricks only lawyers have access to.  There are many law books and help from webpages you can research.  
5. Many districts have statutory fees that a lawyer can receive for probating an estate.  You should find out what fees are normal in your area before you agree to be represented.
6.  If you and your sister are living in your mother's home you want to prioritize payment of the mortgage and utilities.  It is very hard to get out from under foreclosure proceedings, and much more costly in the long run to let those bills fall to the estate's responsibility and have to dig your way out, than it is to maintain the status quo, if possible.  Also paying the household bills is arguably a ""loan"" to the estate, which also makes you a creditor to the estate.  Therefore, keep meticulous records of any expenses you do pay.  
7.Never pay the credit card debts, they are unsecured, and sit at the bottom of the debts paid out by the probate court.  Ignore all the hospital bills (they'll be coming several months after the hospital stay), except as a debt of the Estate.  
8.  In my state, debts of the estate are paid as follows:
Funeral Bill,
Attorney's fees,
Fiduciary fees (the executor gets paid for his work),
Taxes,
Secured creditors,
unsecured creditors,
heirs

9. It is possible you will be forced to sell the house to settle the estate if there is not enough cash/assets to pay the debts.  Don't let that freak you out at the moment.  In my state the court has a nine month window from the opening of an estate to the closing, and that window can be extended many times.  
If you are in the situation where the house is at risk of being sold in order to settle the estate, and you and your sister are staying at the house, then worry the more about maintaining your own good credit than paying the mortgage.  
10. Call the pension administrator.  There may be terms under the pension for this situation that will allow it to transfer to you or your sister.  There may be a death payout that would help you over the hump.
11.  When dealing with any institution do not leave them an original death certificate unless they require it.  Always ask them to keep a copy of your certificate instead.  Get at least 3 but no more than 5 copies of the certified death certificate when you first get them.  Usually the funeral home will ask you how many copies you want.  Later, if you need more copies you will go to the appropriate agency to get them (city hall, probate court, it differs from place to place)

Adenoviruses, albeit similar, are something completely different. AAV is called adeno-associated viruse because in the normal scenario, AAV requires infection with adenovirus (which causes the common cold) in order infect a human cell. Adenovirus is responsible for the [gene therapy disaster](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Gelsinger) that occured around the turn of the century that set back viral mediated gene therapy leaps and bounds. Jesse Gelsingers death (what I linked in the previous sentence) was caused by a systemic inflammatory immune response induced by the virus itself. Since this incident, there has been a lot of research into utilizing viruses that are safer and less immunogenic, and AAV is what this research has produced. Currently, there is a lot of research utilizing this virus, [including clinical trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=adeno-associated+virus&amp;Search=Search), with many different strains being used. [Some strains of AAV have been modified to make them less antigenic in the human body](http://www.nature.com/mt/journal/v20/n2/full/mt2011237a.html) with a some really great success *in humans*. The big problem that we've encountered using AAV is not a systemic inflammatory response, but a normal immune response producing neutralizing antibodies to the AAV strain after repeated use (similar to what a vaccine does). These neutralizing antibodies are produced by the body specifically towards AAV and work to bind AAV in the blood stream inhibiting it's ability to reach the intended target and deliver the genetic payload. Theoretically a response such as this could result in a systemic inflammatory illness, but to my knowledge this hasn't been observed and AAV has been relatively safe.

yes, unless the total exceeds your maximum velocity (ie 40% left and 40% up would only leave 20% forward available)

&gt; Does this mean you fly in decoupled mode 100% of the time?

i never decouple, there is no need for it when you have full control of all 6 degrees of freedom.

startrek,4,0,4,"GOG was pretty fun dude, not sure what you're talking about. Couple that with a pretty extensive comic book line, and a deep tie in to the overall Marvel plot... 

One could say that GoG plays a more important role in the Marvel Universe than Star Trek is even playing in it's own.

I'm going to make this very clear though. A TV style though-provoking Star Trek movie WILL NOT work. Period. What they have to do is create a movie that features a compelling story, likeable characters with real growth, a villain or goal to overcome that is important and meaningful that provides true danger, set in the Star Trek Universe.

You say that Star Trek has baggage? Not Movie Trek. They wrote themselves out of the baggage of having to deal with a canon universe when they separated the storylines. I'm sorry you can't see that, but it's the reality of the situation. ",t3_36hfeu,cre8h3t,t1_cre4r1u,t1_cre8h3t

seduction,2,0,2,"Read ""No More Mr. Nice Guy""... speaking of which, I need to. I keep looking for a free version of the audio book.

I've been there too. You want everyone to like you. You want appreciation, notability for something. ""That's cmiovino, he's really good at X, Y, &amp; Z, and is just really awesome. I want to hang out with him!""... so you try to be a people pleaser. You try to help everyone, be friendly, and in the process, get walked all over by girls and even your guy friends.

The reality is the less you give a fuck, the more people like you. Ever hear of 'girls like assholes'? Well, it's true, only because those assholes simply don't give a fuck and are doing whatever makes them tick. This is attractive to guys, girls, who ever. People want to be around strong people doing themselves and loving it. You (and me before) are trying to please everyone but yourself, which is leading you off your path and mission in life.

Don't take 'not giving a fuck' as just sitting around, noting caring about money, your job, women, friends, and hate everyone. It means don't give a fuck about what others think. Go for what you want and be successful in it. When you do, guy friends, women, elders, whoever will notice and naturally be attracted to you.",t3_36ijkr,crea0q7,t3_36ijkr,t1_crea0q7

Feminism,-6,0,-6,"I think it has to do with what's necessary. Honestly, Ramsay Bolton is a sexual sadist and psychopath. If we wanted to ensure people knew the depths of his villainy, he would literally have to be raping, torturing, abusing, and murdering people in every scene he's in for the show to do his character justice in that regard.

However, this is TV, and there are time constraints. Generally, scenes should be used to advance plot or advance character development. Anything else is a stain on on the show for failing to do its purpose and falling to the dregs of shock-scenes with no substance.

And it would be very easy to argue that the rape scene was 100% schock value, because it did not reveal or progress any character development or plot. We know nothing new about any of the three characters involved except for Sana is now a rape victim, something that could have been inferred instead of shown without any loss in value.

It's the same argument used in the Jaime/Cersei scene...it was unnecessary for it to be rape. We didn't learn anything new, it didn't advance plot, and it was there for shock value. Unnecessary. We already know Westeros is a terrible, cruel violent place.

xboxone,-1,0,-1,"Hang on there buddy, the OP does have a point.

Okay, he's being a little snide about the hypocritical nature of gamer attitudes around DLC, but he does raise a really valid point here.

Day one 'free' DLC is actually a misnomer in itself.  It's clearly content for the game and your initial purchase price covers this as well.  Is it free 'additional' content or simply content that was pushed aside from the core game experience and marketed cleverly as 'free' for PR purposes?

Regardless of whether you're loving the game or not, you do need to step back for a moment and take a more rational and objective view of the situation here.

I'm not at all giving the devs/publishers a kick in the balls for taking this option, but it has to be said that looking at the timing of said release, you can't really view this as 'free' stuff at all.  If you didn't buy the basic game, you can't access this content so 'free' isn't really the whole truth here.

If anything, this is clever marketing that's deemed a positive with the community because they're seeing it as 'extra' content to the core game.

But whether they actually cut said content from the original core game, package it as DLC to ship or whether it truly was developed above and beyond is something you'll never honestly know.",t3_36fjb6,creji1i,t1_cre57gr,t1_creji1i
OCPoetry,1,0,1,"This poem just lacks a rhythmic consistency which I find to be bothersome: I'd not say that a poem has to have consistency, it's that the poem feels like its confused about whether it wants to have it or not. 
Ex: ""What a treasure I have found!/Just lying here upon the ground"" 1st Line 7 Syllables, 2nd Line 8 Syllables, doesn't fit Iambic pentameter quite right, but no worries. 
""Amongst such rubble and debris/Desiring so much to be free"" 3rd Line 8 Syllables, 4th Line 8 Syllables, Fits IP perfectly, I wasn't expecting that type of solid rhyme, but no worries. 
""And what happiness I find/Upon Discovering you could be mine"" 5th Line 7 Syllables, 6th Line 10 Syllables: Dude, wait wut?
If the poem is going to hover around a rhythm, then it should land comfortably within itself still. But if the poem is going to hardcore rhyme in rhythm, then it already has a comfortable landing space: if there was a reason for the disconnect, then I have missed it. 
A solid compromise for keeping to rhythm could be, Ex:
""Oh what a treasure I have found/Just lying here upon the ground""
1st Line 8 Syllables/2nd Line 8 Syllables
""Amongst such rubble and debris/Desiring so much to be free""
3rd Line 8 Syllables/4th Line 8 Syllables
""What happiness I happ'n(Happened) to find/Discovering that you could be mine""
5th Line (Cheating with Happ'n as 1 beat) 8 Syllables/6th Line 8 Syllables

That fits in the rhythm and even has a little odd apostrophe to add to the charm of the style, if thats what you want to go for. Or you could drop the count and just go for a natural flow that is based around the rhyme, but not the rhythm. Ex:
""What a treasure I seem to have found, lying out here, on the ground...
Amongst all this rubble, such hazardous debris, I sense a strong yearning: a desire to be free!
Oh, a great happiness I did find, when I discovered you could possibly be mine.""
This ditches the strict rhythm in favor of a more natural, and conversational tone, while keeping a loose sense of unified rhyme and timing. Either one is fine, but each is rooted firmly in its ""Sound"": the tonal setting which clues the reader into how it can be verbally expressed. The only reason I harp on this is because it seems like a ""Sound"" is what you were going for.

cscareerquestions,218,0,218,"There are hundreds of different roles, but they can probably be divided up into these categories.  I listed some jobs twice because they can have the same title but be focused in one department or another.

**Infrastructure**:  

* [Sysadmin](https://xkcd.com/705/) (managing, setting up, and [keeping systems running](http://www.feedbooks.com/book/335.pdf))
* Dev-ops (creating &amp; using tools that devs use to manage systems)
* Network Engineer (setting up, designing, and optimizing network infrastructures, TCP/IP, and other layers of the network stack)
* Data Center Ops (they keep ""the cloud"" running)
* Cable &amp; Router Technicians (/r/cableporn)
* Database Administrators (generally wizards)
* Technical Support &amp; Documentation (the incredibly tough bastards that actually deal with _ghasp_ users)

**Backend**:  

* Full stack engineers (a little bit of everything)
* Backend Application Development (rails, django, node, etc.)
* Project Management (not always a technical technical role)
* Engineering Management (usually former developers get promoted to this job)
* Software Architects (planning out features before they are coded)
* API Design (designing the interfaces between systems)
* Security &amp; Pentesting
* Distributed System Architects (dealing with [consistency, availability, partition tolerance](http://scale-out-blog.blogspot.com/2012/04/disproving-cap-theorem.html), timing, of large, globally-separated systems)
* Database Administrators (managing, maintaining, sharding, and migrating data stores, different from infrastructure-focused DBAs in that they are also writing backend code which interacts with the stores)

**Frontend**:  

* Full Stack (a little bit of everything, but focused primarily on the pieces that support a frontend)
* UX/UI Front end designers (photoshop, indesign, sketch, html &amp; css, etc. only)
* General front end web development (html, css, **and** js)
* Single-page app development (mostly with JS frameworks, e.g. angular or [react](http://react.rocks/))
* Quality Assurance &amp; Testing (writing tests, doing human tests, making sure things work)

**Native**:
  
* iOS, Android, Windows Mobile, etc.
* Consumer-facing Windows Desktop, OS X Desktop, Linux app development
* Enterprise software development (large, made-to-order applications for businesses)
* IT administration &amp; admin software design (often very system-specific, hence the Native category)
* Software Architecture (similar to backend architecture, designing features before they are coded)

**Science and Theory**:
 
* Scientific Research (loads of Matlab, R, and ipython and more)
* ""Pure Compsci/Pure Math"" Research (with haskell, lisp, lots more)
* Scientific Software Development (e.g. protein folding software)
* Data science (matlab, r, ipython, scikit-learn, etc.)
* Machine Learning (e.g. for [pagerank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank), reverse image search, beer recommendation, used all over the place now)
* Compiler &amp; Language Design (not many jobs but very useful to learn, maybe mozilla foundation &amp; rust?, and Guido certainly gets paid by Dropbox :)
* OS Design (not just microsoft, windows, &amp; linux, also qualcomm and lots of other telecoms hire [tens of thousands](http://www.glassdoor.com/Job/jobs.htm?suggestCount=10&amp;suggestChosen=false&amp;clickSource=searchBtn&amp;typedKeyword=qualcomm&amp;sc.keyword=qualcomm&amp;locT=&amp;locId=&amp;jobType=all) of engineers to write embedded and mobile OSs)
* Compression (you can work for Hooli)

**Marketing**:  
This field has lots of overlap with data science.  

* Growth hacking/web scraping (selenium, beatifulsoup, phantomjs, scikit-learn, pattern, etc.)
* Analytics (GA, mixpanel, optimizely etc. closely tied with marketing and SEO)
* SEO &amp; SEM (techniques to fuck with/obey search engines and convert $$ to visitors)
* General Marketing Development (salesforce, analytics, content-design, and SEO)  

**Hardware and Graphics**:  

* [Embedded Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_software) (code that runs very close to the metal, e.g. the assembly code running your elevator)
* Chip Design &amp; Architecture (wizards)
* Game development (very, very different from other kinds of programmers, questionably human)
* Graphics software development (similar to gaming dev, in my experience, graphics people don't frequently switch to app dev or vice versa, I'd love to hear your comments)
* 3D printing and machining coding
* CGI &amp; Animation  (e.g. disney. pixar devs gave a talk about the wonders of cgi development at Pycon2015)

WhiteRights,-3,0,-3,"&gt;I am eager to look at whatever evidence to the contrary you have. 

Any evidence for a claim about a trait that relies on something like a genome will involve reference to that genome, or, at the very least, a plausible theory rendered from findings that suggests the existence of that genome. A possible theory for scientists involves a very high standard of probabilty (something like 99.999.) There are no such findings to justify your claim.

Furthermore, the explanation of the cause of a behavior will certainly involve reference to brain function. That is, behavioral traits along the lines of what you're saying should be evinced in a cognitive model that involves a reductive explanation of intentional states and content.  And not only does no such model exist, recent findings suggest that no such model _could_ exist. Specifically, it seems that cognitive function with respect to the propagation of neurons is probably not capable of being described with a linear computation. The reason we think this is the case is that it seems that no computable system is capable of self-observation, which in turn suggests that brain function is non-linear, i.e., a dynamic, chaotic, closed quantum system.

In short, we aren't even _close_ to being able to pinpoint what events at the neurological level cause people to behave as they do. And, it may be not only physically but mathematically impossible to do this. 

Finally, there is no observed difference among the brains that is correlated to differences in ""ethnicity"" (which, actually, is a very empty term. It means nothing, really, so far as a deep theory of science is concerned.)

&gt;I think it's pretty clear that these tendencies are correlated with genetic factors, as are all human behavioral traits.

If they are correlated with genetic factors, then you should be able to specify which physical structures are responsible for these tendencies.

asoiaf,2,0,2,"I have some very obscure and thin, super 'maybe' evidence to add to this from 5.06:


Back in 2006, Sony held a Press Conference at E3 where they went over the new Playstation 3. Everyone in video game culture, hundreds of thousands, lambasted it to the degree you're seeing in the ASOIAF fandom with quotes and videos everywhere of Dorne in the show. Sony was the absolute laughing stock, and it set the tone for the XBox 360 to become the main system of the 2006-2014 video game era. In particular, the stupidest moment was this, when a guy came out and advocated a game that was based on actual history... and then proceeded [to introduce this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2g1fr5vk72M) The phrase, ""So here's this giant enemy crab"" was a huge deal, along with attacking something's weakpoint ""for massive damage.""


Anyway, when I was watching 5.06, Cogman has this one line in there that Tyrion said which instantly reminded me of this, and came off as strange wording to me: ""She's ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf."" I know it's really vague, and so lose, but it came off as odd language to me, and I wonder if Cogman wasn't affected by this phenomenon many years ago and snuck that language in there because it was on his mind when thinking of the crabs, and wanted to make use of the same language and flip it back, in-world for Tyrion to mock Jorah's plan.",t3_2zcz87,crewwwn,t3_2zcz87,t1_crewwwn

On the one hand, they don't want to accept that a minority is acting badly. Left only likes to criticize the powerful majority, and feels that criticizing minorities for any reason is racist. And the other hand, you have politicians like Haper who are over hyping the threat to pass draconian legislation. The response by the left is often to just dismiss the entire threat entirely as fabricated. 

""Terrorism"" has a wokny definition. but the simple ""political violence by non-state actors"" definition, the act fits completely. Michael Zehaf-Bibeau had a clear religious and political ideology and agenda.

Leftists pointed to his past drug use and mental illness issues. But this is the nature of the ""lone wolf"" aspect of Islamic State attacks in the West. IS wishes to capture and maintain terrirtory in the Middle-East. They will encourage their followers to carry out attacks in the West, but they will typically not fund, or train them. This is in contrast with Al Qaeda and other groups, who would invest millions in training and carrying out attacks in the West. So IS tends to attract losers to carry out their attacks, and AQ tended to attract more normal and stable people.

Gender_Critical,-1,0,-1,"I am going to be honest about what my views are regarding this, and you are probably not going to like it. But I am going to answer you as best I can.

In my experience, my presence in womens spaces hasn't caused an obvious problem. And this is the case for the vast, vast, vast majority of trans people. So when you say ""women"" it is a bit misleading. The entirety of women haven't said no and are being ignored. That cause...just isn't that big right now. You probably have explanations why but I genuinely believe it is because people are very capable of being accomadating and accepting. Especially when it doesn't actually cause any real problems.

But there is a whole group (probably most of the people on this sub) whose argument is that they just don't want to be near trans women because they find them distasteful or ridiculous or just plain don't like them. It always sounds like the right people here are defending is ""the right to not be around trans women because....ew"".

If it is that ""right"" vs the right for a woman (who is trans) to be able to go to places and do things everyone else can....the latter wins. And like I said in another answer, sometimes the arguments I see here mirror the arguments made against race mixing in the 60's.

""I don't mind trans women, but I don't want them using my bathroom"".

I actually followed c25k and I've been running a little over a year.  I've read the training approaches by Daniels, Pfitzinger, and others and they are great resources but I don't think their plans are the best approach for most beginners because of the weekly mileage that is required for these plans to work.

I started out not really being impressed by Higdon because he seems to try to appeal to the masses and comes off just sounding too simple.  But, honestly, I think his plans are the best approach for anybody that is starting out and averaging less that 40 miles per week.  

I'm using Higdon's novice 2 marathon plan now and I've been really happy with it.

EDIT:   

21Inc is jumping to the mining endgame.   The block reward was meant to be a bootstrapping mechanism and it's unclear if fees will cover the costs to adequately secure Bitcoin.   So the only way to have a strong network of computers securing the blockchain is to socialize the cost in some way.  

Many think this should be done via inflation that gets paid to miners, but that completely undermines the principles Bitcoin was founded on.  Plus inflation hurts everyone holding/using bitcoin regardless of wealth (regressive).  However, with micro miners, the affluent that have tons of electronic devices will be the ones paying for the network.  

If you want to checkout of the system and cut your costs, get rid of your micro miners.   Contrast this choice with monetary inflation, which is inescapable, and it's obvious which system is better.

2. If you don't speak Spanish/ German/ French as a native English speaker, this means that you cannot order your Margarita in Localese. You can still order it in English though, chances are the waitstaff knows sufficient amounts. However, if you don't speak English as a Spanish/ German/ French guy, YOU CANNOT LEAVE YOUR COUNTRY. I cannot overstate how important this is to us non-native speakers: We don't speak English to do English natives a favour, or to win against you at scrabble, or for internet points. WE SPEAK ENGLISH BECAUSE WE HAVE TO, to talk to Indians, Chinese, Russians and each other, because NO-ONE speaks German (in my case), so if I don't speak English I am trapped in Germany. So for most European kids growing up, this is the number one most important class in school, and one of the few you actually study for.  
3. Also Simpsons, Futurama, South Park, Family Guy and understanding why Bruce Springsteen is so very, very creepy when he sings ""Hey kleines Maedchen ist Dein Papi zuhause, hat er Dich hier einfach alleingelassen? Ojeh, Ich empfinde ein dunkles Verlangen... ich brenne!"". There. Now you also know how it is for us growing up, mindlessly singing along to all kinds of English language drivel until you realise in your late teens that you loudly sang along to an ode to pedophilia. So yeah, culture influence, too.  
  
...hope that helps, now stop asking why I speak English so well and instead buy me a beer (seriously, the conversation always plays out the same way...).  
TL;DR: Jim Jeffries paraphrase: We don't speak English well because we WANT to. WE SPEAK ENGLISH WELL BECAUSE WE HAVE TO!",t3_36q29t,crg92fp,t3_36q29t,t1_crg92fp

WritingPrompts,1331,0,1331,"I prefer the term ""clinical."" It makes people think of scientists in labs or doctors curing people. ""Psychopath"" is just ugly. It conjures images of knife-wielding maniacs. Both words mean the same thing: devoid of emotional attachment. So does it really matter? Yes. Appearance is everything is this world, and I am a chameleon. 

My hobby started out as an experiment. I adhere rigorously to the scientific method, you know, and set out to prove that I really am a psychopath. I'd always had an inkling, even from a young age. Others may experiment with torturing animals or even peers to probe the depths of how far their emotional void goes. They want to inflict pain to confirm that they don't feel the same. But I took a different tack: I tried making people laugh. Or smile. Or cry (with joy, that is). And it became an addiction. Seeing their happiness doesn't affect me in the slightest, but I did enjoy being able to control their emotions. They were only happy because *I* made them that way.

My first major success was a young woman in college. The subject's name was Sarah. We've all seen the type: going out drinking every night and ending up in a different man's bed who wouldn't even know her name by the next morning. And so ashamed of her behavior that she wouldn't want him to remember. I watched her for weeks, observing her self-imposed isolation and continuing downward spiral. And I saw her sit in her bathtub for over an hour one night with a razor blade, before climbing out sobbing. I had done small acts for people in the past, but this is when I really decided to go all out. I was going to change Sarah's life.

I correctly estimated that she'd been brought up by overbearingly religious parents who stifled any thoughts of sexuality and independence. Now that she was away at school, the pendulum had swung to the other side, and she'd had a major falling out with her parents over her lifestyle. 

I don't really know why I picked Sarah. There was nothing special about her, and we were barely acquainted; we just had one class together. Maybe that was it, though: maybe if I could help *her*, it would set a precedent that I could help *anyone*. 

The first step was not pretty. She was found in the middle of the quad, passed out with an open bottle of vodka. She had no memory of getting there, nor any recollection that I had carried her. Or that I had been the one at the party who kept matching her shot-for-shot (and pouring them over my shoulder). She was punished by the school, but not as severely as the police would have. I knew that a criminal charge would do more harm than good, so I abandoned my initial plan to fake a DUI crash with her behind the wheel. But showing her consequences was the first step to her sobriety.

I called her Dad the next day. ""Dr. Hamilton,"" was the alias I used, I think. Fictional names are always so hard to come up with. I told him that she was in a coma after a severe car accident, and we needed him to come right away in case she passed on. I can only imagine his reaction when he found out the truth, but it had the intended effect: they reconciled. Family bonds have always been a challenge for me to dissect, but I know that a crisis (real or not) can be an amazing catalyst.

The next few months were a laundry list of smaller things to help get her on her way. I would arrange for her to meet with people that I thought had compatible personalities, and she eventually developed a close-knit group of friends who didn't just want to get hammered at frat parties. It was as simple as ensuring that some of them failed the right classes so that they'd have to take makeup exams with Sarah. She began to study and raised her grades to an acceptable level. And eventually I made sure that she met that quiet guy from her Biology class who'd always had a bit of a crush on her. I'm not proud of how I accomplished *that*, but I think that if the happy couple ever found out, they'd understand why I did what I did. She's on her way to medical school now, where I unfortunately won't be able to continue my 'guidance.' But I have a good feeling that she won't need it anymore. 

I wish I could say that this made me happy. Or sad to lose her. Or anything. But, I can't say those things. At the end of three years of obsessing over Sarah's life, my only thought is: who will the next specimen be?

Edit: alright imma elaborate a little.

I'm a pretty fit guy (played basketball in college), and after years of dating all these white skinny bimbo models, I pretty much only date women on the slightly chubbier side. There are a lot of women out there that are beautiful people in general, that immature guys take points off just because they are a little big. 

Like for real, their personalities are better, they are better in the sack, and they are fuckin hilarious to be around. 

My girls a little big. And Whenever I bring her around to all my old buds, some of the ones who haven't matured yet give me shit for dating someone a little on the thicker side. But fuck them! I see them with their girl, that little skinny chick with cheekbones too high up and no ass to speak of, always complaining and wanting to go home cause she feels tired, or sick, or whatever. Me and my girl are just having a blast man, it's fun when you got someone that can throw down more shots that you can.

My advice is....marry for personality, not for looks. You'll thank me later bruh, when you see half your friends going through divorces about some stupid shit.

This is a very good and important question though. 

Another thing to remember is that the WH and NSA know exactly what's in USA Freedom.

WTF,926,0,926,"1 atm is at sea level. With every 33 feet/10 metres the pressure increases 1 atm/bar. At the same time your lung volume gets smaller, gases are being compressed inside your body. The first bar cuts your volume in half, after 66F/20m is your lung at 33% and a depth of 99F/30m means 25% capacity compared to sea level. 

The opposite happens when the pressure decreases (~~by diving up~~ ascending): The volume of all gases increases. Contrary to the descent, your body needs time to release those gases (which are trapped inside your body fluids and tissue) via breathing at a certain pressure/depth. The difference between states of pressure is called partial pressure gradient. Is that gradient high and you ~~dive up~~ ascend too fast then the unresolved gases (primarily nitrogen) will cause serious damage due to expansion. That's why you need to monitor the diving depth and time very closely.

*Afterthought: As /u/poco mentioned, the first paragraph describes more the situation when you free dive than scuba dive. The second stage of the diving regulator (scuba) supplies the diver with air relative to the ambient pressure. That means when your lung capacity would normally be at 25% capacity (99F/30m) the gas density needs to be increased by a factor of 4 to maintain the same volume.

That also explains why Java, PHP and a few other languages of this kind used predominantly by people in their jobs have comparatively poor (quantity and quality) library ecosystems while languages with small but enthusiastic communities likes Haskell have many.

kancolle,0,0,0,"Most powerful ships would be the three LSC only battleships, and you want Z1 before attempting them as Trying for Biscuit can give you Yamato class just as easily.

Regarding Taihou, unless you really want her, or get really lucky..

Such mixed feelings about her, I really wanted her bad before I started playing, but the whole glorious image of carriers in general has dimmed a bit after learning how to use them most efficiently.

I'm going off a tangent a bit here so bear with me.

People regard Carriers as a whole as baux eating monsters, and this is true to an extend. 

for example if you accidentally press forwards after 3-2a with a 3-4 carrier fleet with full blue planes, the next node will cost you as much as 500 to 700 bauxite because you lost air supremacy to the enemy and all of your bombers got shot down.

If you go to the same node with enough green planes to reach Air supremacy, you might lose as little as 50 to 100 bauxite.

if you walk the middle road and just aim for Air superiority, to have more powerful opening strike and shelling, you'll probably have 200 to 400 less baux after resupply.

If you aim for air supremacy, you lose way less bauxite, at the cost of higher ammount of repairs, meaning more fuel/steel and most importantly, buckets used.

So it comes down to priorities, which one do you value more, your bauxite or your buckets.

Lets see then, buckets are pretty self explanatory, and maybe bauxite too to some extend, but having more of both gives you more choices in your gameplay.

I probably could go on some more but.. 

Now we come back to Taihou, and rng to some extend.

Do you choose to try your luck with a carrier recipe in LSC, 5k or more a pop and hope for a miracle, or craft better planes and radars instead.

When you fail enough of carrier recipe LSC you start thinking of ways to reduce your bauxite costs, and suddenly we're back to gaining air supremacy whenever possible, and even using your carriers as Green plane only mules, this is more of an event experience but still somewhat relevant.

and then coming back a full circle, why did you try to get Taihou in the first place when you only use your carriers as reppu mules to reduce your bauxite costs? :&lt;

No need for a armoured carrier when they don't have any attack planes equipped.

TL:DR farming Bauxite sucks, RNG is a bitch, LSC Taihou in mind sinks you to dark places.

news,-7,0,-7,"""toning the body"" is a misconception. You can't tighten your butt, make your thighs killer, tone the abs or any of that other bullshit. If you lose fat, you lose fat everywhere. If you want to ""tone"" some area, you're probably going to end up ""toning"" all of your body; fitness and ""tone"" is a whole body thing. ""Targeting"" muscle groups doesn't make a difference unless you take it to an extreme (professional athlete level). This is especially true with inane shit like doing ""crutches"", ""ab workouts"" in general and anything ""targeting"" the butt.

Exercise in general is not a good form of fat loss. It's good for staying healthy and for keeping your metabolism regular (""high metabolism"", with the exception of disorders, is pretty much a myth as well; normal people see no noticeable differences in difficulty gaining/losing weight from metabolism differences). Exercise alone is not going to magically drop tons of weight off of you. When running a marathon, most runners burn about 100 calories a mile. A snickers bar is almost equivalent to a 5k race.

The best way to ""tone your body"" is to first and *foremost* watch your diet. While you're doing that, you should do heavy weightlifting 3x a week, or progressive overload styled bodyweight exercising (not ""pushups, situps and crutches""). You should be trying to gain as much muscle as possible and regulate your body weight by eating healthy food. If you want a healthy heart and VO2 max, the best way to go about that is HIIT stuff like wind sprints or training for long distance running (a 14 minute mile on the elliptical also doesn't count when you don't get faster after three months). VO2 max and healthy heart prevents stuff like getting winded when rapidly climbing up 3 flights of stairs at once.

By healthy food, I mean food that contains good and balanced levels of fat and a balanced level of nutrients. Sugar should be avoided like the plague and artificial sugar is even worse than normal sugar. Fat is healthy for the body and trans fat is not a sin.

tl;dr: squatz+oatz get you a killer body, intense cardio gets you a super healthy heart and VO2 max. Food with fat in it is not evil (bacon is healthy, mcdonalds is not). Sugar is the devil and artificial sugar is the devil's evil twin. But seriously, squatz+oatz.

---

But, like I said, telling people that everything they think they know about exercise and nutrition is completely wrong is something I've learned not to do. They tend to not take kindly to it and I come off as a hypocrite since I know all of this and don't really do much about it (I don't worry about my sugar intake, for example).",t3_36thah,crhd8i9,t1_crhcxdv,t1_crhd8i9

I'm talking about a choice between getting a cheaper unlocked phone vs paying more money in the long run for a higher-end phone that the consumer actually desires, via contact.  The ability to pay incrementally for high-end familiar phones that they couldn't afford up-front is exactly why contracts persist.  Many people would rather get, say, an iPhone or Galaxy on contact vs paying for a slightly less expensive phone up front that they either don't know much about or simply don't want, even if it means paying more in long term.

Things that do effect latency though...

1. Tier1/Tier2/Tier3 networks like XO.net that connect ISPs to other ISPs
2. How taxed your connection is. With a torrent running somewhere on your home network, you're likely to get poor latency.

Not acknowledging this loss would be extremely rude, and to be honest, from an interpersonal politics sort of viewpoint, your fight with her is pretty small compared to the loss of a grandmother. Also: don't forget that the issue isn't that you have this fight and you need to *win*, but rather, you need to keep this from giving you a bad reputation in your hometown that keeps you from having healthy relationships with the people of your choice.

So. Send a card to her AND her family, and make sure the topic of the card is about the grandmother and comforting them, not about how much you feel for them or your sympathy. If you had family members who also knew her family, have them sign the card as well (it reduces the personal connection). Do NOT include a personal note or try to steer the converstation towards you in any way. Do not send flowers, go to the wake, or the funeral (unless another family specifically asks you to go).

Documentaries,1,0,1,"&gt; I need a proper source about what exact process you're talking about.

Very few sources of information on what is truly going on with HFT exist because all of the firms involved with it have a vested interest in keeping *what* it is away from the public eye as well as each has their own ""special sauce"" algorithms that they guard with every fiber of their being.  I already mentioned the book ['Flash Boys'](http://www.amazon.ca/Flash-Boys-Wall-Street-Revolt-ebook/dp/B00HVJB4VM) which is about the closest thing to a comprehensive report on the topic.  If you are at all interested in this problem for real, then this book is a must read and explains everything in horrifying detail.  

&gt;What you're describing ,if true, in no way represents the overwhelming majority of HFT.

That's the Wall Street party line, but it's not correct at all.  All of the big firms are now running dark pools of their own, the number of exchanges and order types have exploded with HFT and there are untold millions of orders being issued daily that will never be fulfilled on purpose.  HFT is there like a parasite sucking just a few drops of blood per day, all day everyday.

Games,141,0,141,"You have no idea what you're talking about.

**Wildstar lost the majority of the people playing it before they even reached max level.**  Yes, it was too grindy, and yes 40 man raiding was not the best idea, and yes, attunement was not handled very well.

The narrative on Reddit is that a bunch of whiny ex-hardcore WoW raders realized they were wrong and all quit, leaving Wildstar to rot, but the reality is most of Wildstar's players never saw the inside of a raid.

People quit because the game was buggy as hell, or because the quest UI and experience were generally not the best, or because it ran like shit on computers that were less than two years old, because low-level content was discouragingly difficult, because hacking and cheating ruined the economy, because PvP was broken and unrewarding, because gear is confusing and poorly designed, because grinding isn't fun, and so on, and so on, and so on.  Wildstar's failures had almost *nothing* to do with how ""hardcore"" the endgame content was or wasn't.  They had to do mostly with the fact that Carbine and NCSoft rushed an unfinished product out the door.

It'd be nice if people who have never played the game could refrain from talking about what Wildstar's flaws were.  The perceived ""hardcoreness"" of Wildstar was only one of many debilitating issues and had it been a very hardcore but also very polished game, it probably would have succeeded, or at least been more successful (even though I think making content inaccessible and difficult is not a great choice).

If it needs a service offered by another machine, it can spend its money.

Top control is a deck centered around [[lantern of insight]], a neat little card. You get that one out, then shred of the top cards of your opponent's library that you don't want them to have. Tools for this are cards like [[codex shredder]], [[ghoulcaller's bell]] and [[Pyxis of Pandemonium]] (Yes, that silly theros rare. Need to exile some pesky stuff like emerakul right?). This goes both ways, you get to ""scry"" kind of, dictating your own draws. Isn't that neat?  
  
To combat creatures, you run 4x[[ensarling bridge]]. That way, it's total lockdown. Have a few shuffle effects like elixir of immortality as an example so you don't mill yourself out. Lantern can also be used for this + emergency-shuffle your opponent's library in case you can't remove a pesky card of the top any other way.  You need some cheap discard like duress (or more expensive things like toughtseize etc) to get away cards that are drawn already. 
  
Bridge is a must, that's the only ""expensive"" card you absolutely need to have. If that isn't a problem, have fun. You can sit there and taunt them, acting sad that they have such bad draws and never topdeck anything. It's hilarious. ",t3_371ir2,crixmsi,t1_criwu82,t1_crixmsi

If you had an equally spiteful comment about an in-game feature, it would be in your right. 

But please don't get venomous like this, it's why many of us avoid other forums. It would be nice if you would hold yourself to your own standards in this regard.

Downvotes should be reserved for pointless, negative comments like yours that contribute nothing of value to the topic at hand. So just letting you know why I think it was right for me to give you one, if I've got the wrong idea of how reddit should work please let correct me.

and you say:

&gt;They took it out and it was awful lol. Early game was slower and more boring. I think they did it in... early s4? After months of it being gone, everyone asked for it back and Riot decided it was the best decision to have it in the game, after having experimented with it not being there.

Idk that seems kind of conflicting. Saying that i'm overstating how big 100g is when i'm just saying it's unnecessary to have and unfair to have it when it's just another kill. And then you say ""it was the best decision to have it in the game."" 

Also i'm not saying it's not a small amount of gold in the long run i'm just saying it provides a lot more of an advantage in the early game than people seem to realize. And since realistically first blood is mostly gained *in the early game* it seems silly to have it. It provides a lot more options for purchasing early items.

Also I looked up the bonus gold removal and that was done with a *TON OF HUGE CHANGES* I think it would be impossible to say that it was simply the removal of gold bonus that made the entire game slower. It seems like it was the massive jungle changes that contributed to that.

An EVGA GTX 970 should be as solid as whatever I wrote before, no problem with that.

If I'm understanding, there has not been any video signal passed across the HDMI cable although it goes over VGA just fine. There's a couple options: hardware or software. To see if hardware is bad, you'll want to test each component that you can, probably starting with whatever is easiest for your time's sake. If you have another HDMI cable then try that, or if your other computer has HDMI then does that cable definitely work in the same way? You can try turning off the machine psu then removing the 970 from its slot and trying the motherboard onboard video outputs. If you don't remove the card, onboard graphics may be automatically deactivated in the UEFI BIOS. It is theoretically possible for a port to be damaged on the TV or the graphics card - glance for any obvious physical damage and try different ports.

For software, you'll want to look yo see if

Am I understanding that when tried unplugging the VGA cable, plugging in the HDMI cable, then restarting, your computer appears like it correctly boots but only for a short time, then powers down?

WTF,-10,0,-10,"Let's see if I can make this plain to you:

If your friend gets roofied at a bar, and your reaction is, ""Well, god, you have to make sure that you watch your drink at all times!"" instead of, ""Oh my god, that sucks, are you all right? Is there anything I can do? I hope they get the motherfucker,"" then you're an asshole. Because guess what: there are around eleven people in the US who don't know about roofies who are over the age of 10, and they're all male. So what you're actually saying is, ""Clearly you just weren't vigilant enough, and that's why you got hurt. Because if you were just vigilant like I'm telling you to be, then clearly nothing could have happened."" Which is just another way of saying, ""It's your fault.""

It may even not be what you mean to say (although it really is what it boils down to), but in the event that doesn't matter. Because it's what the victim HEARS that matters, especially since the victim is not in what you want to call perfect mental condition at the time. You supposedly are. So maybe you think a little extra-hard about how your words are going to impact them.

So we have a sign here that basically says, ""Hey, we know you're being bullied. And maybe you tried to stand up to your bully and you got the snot pounded out of you by him and three of his friends. But we just want you to know that whenever you stand up to a bully RIGHT, they will go and pick on someone else instead of you! (Which is super-great, because then someone else gets the snot beaten out of them, and obviously you don't care about anyone but yourself.) So hey, I guess it really is your fault that that bully is still bullying you, huh?'

Speaking as someone who got the snot beaten out of him on multiple occasions, gee, I sure wish I'd known that saying 'I don't like what you're doing' was the magic button, instead of telling them to stop, yelling at them, trying to fight them, etc. I'm sure that this sign would have made ever so much of a difference in my life.",t3_375abw,crjyfrm,t1_crjxloz,t1_crjyfrm

He was a bruiser and he owned the block and fought to keep it. Everyone hated it and avoided him. I gave him some deer meat one day and he bonded with me. We were bros for life after that. Hed snuggle me and dry blood would flake off onto my shirt. Then one day he came up the driveway walking funny and had some puddles for behind him. Old dude had tangled with a racoon that was bigger and meaner than him. Ripped my bro up good. He slumped down and I petted his stabbed, torn, smelly head till he left me.

If I was rude or disrespectful with her, everybody would end up knowing, sooner or later.

Aside from that, let me ask you a question: when men touched you, did you feel disrespected/bad afterwards?

I'm all in for bringing good experiences and feelings for everyone that I meet, despite being straight.

I tried to speak, but I couldn't.  I tried to move, but I was frozen;
And then she started chuckling to herself and I was petrified; it felt so real that at some point I decided, ""we'll if I'm gonna die, better not give her the satisfaction of seeing me scared"" so I started laughing as loud as I could, although no sound came out so it was more of a mime, right at her, hoping it would deter her.  Then I came to, and she was gone.  I couldn't sleep alone for months.

* Start out with what everyone does: Hello World!

Palestinians wouldn't have to worry any more about border disputes----because they would be recognized as citizens of Israel-----and both radical elements of the IDF and Hamas would be more easily prosecuted/targeted in the event an abuse of power or security threats happens.

Here is what happens in a minimal system boot:

A typical small ARM-style system doesn't have a 'BIOS' or 'EFI' or anything on it. When you 'turn on' the system then voltage is applied to the 'SoC' and the processor immediately begins executing any code that may exist at address 0x0 (or 0x8000 or whatever it is for that particular processor). This corresponds to physical traces on the motherboard and a flash chip.  

That flash will be programmed with your 'Boot loader'.  You see the SoC doesn't understand how the hardware is configured or anything like that. It doesn't know what the pins on the processor does or how to use main memory. It doesn't know how to read your SD card or turn on a network interface or anything like that. The bootloader must actually program the low-level interfaces on the SoC to even begin to be using memory or anything like that.  As a programmer it would be your job to know how to flip the bits and detect memory so that the computer can begin using it. Then whatever storage device you want to use for the OS.. you have to configure that also.  Just a minimal amount to activate the larger storage device and load and execute the Linux kernel.

So a operating system doesn't actually need any sort of 'firmware' at all. There is no absolute need for a BIOS or EUFI or anything like that.  The Linux kernel itself can do all the configuration that is necessary, but you need something very specific to that mainboard that knows how to do the lowest levels of configuration.. which is what coreboot is for.

Which is why on your ARM-based phone or MIPS router or whatever you can 'brick' it by a doing a bad bootloader flash.  Without a functioning bootloader there is no way to interact with the hardware. (Although modern systems are incorporating more features to avoid these problems and make it more friendly to ham-fisted firmware updaters)

The BIOS originally was developed as a sort of ghetto operating system. 

It was designed for a era were you didn't have operating systems. You had single-task machines that when they booted they just launched a single application.

The BIOS then provided a set of functions and resources that applications could use to run.  It had some fonts, CGA graphics API, ability to read floppy drives and that sort of thing. 

The BIOS really is a API of sorts.

Cracking and cloning the BIOS was a huge step forward for PC systems because for the first time it allowed applications written for one PC to be executed successfully on a PC clone. 

Later on people produced disk operating systems... which all they did was provide a file system for managing files on a disk.  MS-DOS was one of many for x86 systems, but many other types of architectures had DOS systems as well. 

When Microsoft finally started coming out with real operating systems like Windows 95 for the PC the BIOS was used for boot strapping the OS. 

The x86 'bootloader' is then really a x86 BIOS program used to launch OSes.  Of course Windows 95 wasn't that smart so you still relied on the BIOS to configure bits and pieces of hardware. 

Later on, of course, you had things like ACPI so that the OS had a standardized way to interact with the hardware for power management among other things. 

So with x86 you had a sort of 'dual OS' thing going were you had this stupid ghetto OS people referred to as the 'BIOS' or 'Firmware' and then the real OS for running applications. 

The BIOSes typically are kinda shit. They are going to be specific to specific hardware, but typically how they are programmed is that they are copy and pasted from older mainboard designs and then screwed around with until they boot windows.  So in your BIOS-based x86 system you will have lots of bastardized code that is floating around that is designed to run hardware from 20 years ago.


This sort of thing is why Linux kernel programmers have to spend a great deal of time 'undoing' the damage caused to your system by it's BIOS. 


These sorts of things have some benefits, of course.  When you load a OS and bootloader for x86 the hardware is 'made generic' through the use of the BIOS.  If you ever tried to build your own OS for a smart phone you'd realize that you need to program  and build the kernel and bootloader for that specific device... that is a kernel/bootloader from a different system won't work because the hardware is different.  With X86 systems the BIOS hides the details and allows a single binary bootloader and kernel to easily work across a wide variety of systems. 


UEFI, is then, a modernized BIOS.  Instead of having a mixture of ancient x86 machine code and assembly written by retarded monkeys they have much more 'modern' approach. 

It is much more sophisticated and flexible.  It has it's own programming languages and interpreters. Firmware on UEFI-enabled devices like video cards can load their own 'drivers' that allow them to be used directly by UEFI. 

All sorts of crap like that. 

Which is why now you can have these really fancy 'graphical' EUFI configuration screens. The UEFI firmware on your peripheral devices can provide rich interfaces for how to interact with the hardware. 

Unfortunately this means that it's extremely complicated and big. The firmware is now as big and complicated as a full-fledged OS.

Complicated and big is bad.  This means more bugs. Some bugs are security bugs so more bugs means more security holes.  Also it's generally proprietary so you have different groups of people trying to write the same thing from scratch so they can inject their 'secret sauce'.  So now not only you have something that is big and buggy, but also has lots of different sets of unique bugs. 

But it still allows Microsoft to crank out one binary that works generically across a bunch of different hardware.

Also it allows for a lot of fancy new ways to manage your hardware independently of the OS. Which while often convenient it is also going to be full of bugs and is proprietary. Which is going to be especially bad when the UEFI stuff allows for _remote_ configuration and will piggy back on your network interfaces and doesn't go away completely when the real OS is loaded.

EDIT: A lot of people are still calling what these criminals did ""hacking."" In order to hack they needed to exploit an existing flaw in the computer system. This is very hard to do. Mainly because these functions wouldn't purposely be put into a system. They have to be accidentally created. Also because this exploit must be unknown to the creators and maintainers of the system, otherwise they would patch it immediately (usually). An example is [SQL Injection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) or [Heartbleed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed). [Here is another, fantastic example in gif form.](http://i.imgur.com/rG0p0b2.gif) 

The key quality of a hack is exploiting the system to do something *it wasn't intended to do*. You are getting it to perform a function the creators didn't purposely give it and most likely don't want it to have. 

A great analogy is to picture the IRS database as a room. The computer that serves as an interface to the system would be the locked door. In this scenario, hacking would be knowing that jimmying the lock would get the door to open without having to use a key. Or by lifting the door handle up it unlocks. Or sliding a credit card through the crack. These are functions that the door wasn't designed to have. These functions were weaknesses in the design that shouldn't be there. They are oversights. 

What the criminals did was basically find the keys to the room and unlock the door. The door did exactly what it was supposed to do, open when given a correct key. The system wasn't hacked, they didn't exploit an unintended function of the computer system. And [Social Engineering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28security%29) isn't hacking. It's exploiting the humans that are actors with the system.

**tl;dr:** calling this a hack is like calling a burglar opening your front door with a stolen key ""lockpicking""

Outside of his politics, he's portrayed in a positive light. He's one of the more level headed, wise, and tough characters. He's essentially the father figure on the show in the ""tough but fair"" vein.

That being said, I do think he toes the line between friendly caricature and mockery from time to time. I'm not sure if that's the writers taking shots at libertarianism or them trying to keep PnR from being considered a ""conservative"" show because let's face it, show business is a pretty liberal scene.

As a libertarian I love both Ron Swanson and PnR. I think Ron has exposed a larger audience to libertarianism in a positive way. While Ron is occasionally a means for the writers to poke fun at libertarians he is mostly portrayed as an intelligent, sensible guy.

tl;dr: He's not the *perfect* ambassador for libertarianism but he's a predominantly sympathetic character. Given the left leaning nature of Hollywood, he's portrayed about as positively as I could expect.",t3_37djey,crlu1lj,t3_37djey,t1_crlu1lj

rocketbeans,1,0,1,"Zuerst mal ein großes Dankeschön für die Hausaufgaben der Kino+ Belegschaft, hierbei wurden bereits ein paar Filme in Aufgabe gestellt, die ansonsten an mir vorbeigegangen wären. Mit der Hausaufgabe Chiko fühlte ich mich auch genötigt, endlich einen Reddit-Account zu erstellen.  
Ich fange mit einer kurzen Beschreibung des Films an, später liste ich einfach ein paar Beobachtungen auf, welche mir am Film aufgefallen sind. 
„Chiko ist ein milieubezogener, dramatischer Gangsterfilm, welcher durch seine Härte und Authentizität überzeugt. Der Wunsch nach Respekt und die Ambitionen des jungen Chiko treffen hierbei auf seine Loyalität und seine gering vorhandene Moralität.“

Hier noch ein paar Beobachtungen meinerseits (solltet diese jemand anders gesehen haben, bitte kommentieren, würde mich interessieren wie diese eurerseits aufgenommen wurden):
-	Schwarze Kleidung (meist Lederjacken) und Dreitagesbärte sind in Chiko die Berufsbekleidung der Gangster. Auffällig ist  hierbei das Scholle diese nicht trägt und schnell seines Berufes entledigt wird. Curly trägt zu Beginn ebenfalls noch diese Kleidung, als er allerdings aussteigt nicht mehr. 
-	Religiöse Symbole: Symbole aus dem Christentum und dem Islam tauchen immer wieder auf. In Szenen in denen ein Prozess des Nachdenkens gezeigt wird werden oft Positionen des Betens eingenommen.
Chikos echter Name (Issa) und Meryems Namen bedeuten Jesus und Maria. Hier zeigt sich allerdings das der Film die Namen seiner Charaktere häufig als widersprüchlich mit deren Eigenschaften nimmt. So ist zum Beispiel Meryem klar das Gegenteil einer Jungfrau Maria oder Tibet zeigt kaum eine moralische Vorstellung des Buddhismus.
-	Chiko und Tibet sehen sich als Brüder. In der finalen Szene wird uns ein Brudermord der beiden präsentiert, welcher in der Bibel und Koran den Südenfall der Menschheit weiter beschreibt. 
-	In Chiko und seinen Freunden werden uns drei Charaktere gezeigt, welche alle drei versuchen ihren Platz zu finden. Curly kommt noch von den dreien noch am besten weg (Schusswunde), da er es schafft auszusteigen. Tibet versucht Brownie zu bestehlen um diesen zu schädigen und sich selbst zu bereichern. Dabei verliert er schlussendlich seine Mutter, welche er retten wollte, seine Freund Chiko und seinen Verstand. Am meisten verliert Chiko, da er am weitesten in die kriminelle Welt eintaucht. Sein Versuch der Läuterung (Szene am Zug, „Ich bin Isa“, seinen krimineller Charakter Chiko will er nicht mehr) wird durch seine Freundschaft zu Tibet und seine Entscheidung (Autobahn und das Schild Ausfahrt) zu diesem zurückzukehren zerstört. 
-	Kampfszenen werden immer ohne Musik präsentiert, dadurch wirken diese härter und authentischer. 
-	Zu Beginn kann Chiko Curly nicht ermorden, da dessen Frau und Kind anwesend sind. Womöglich ist er auch selbst zu diesem Zeitpunkt noch nicht bereit einen Mord zu verüben. Die Schläger von Curly haben allerdings keine moralische Bedenken Tibets Mutter zu ermorden. Ab diesem Zeitpunkt ist auch Chiko bereit diese Grenze zu überschreiten und ermordet Curly vor dessen Familie. 
-	Alle männlichen Haupt- und Nebendarsteller haben zwei Persönlichkeiten, bei manchen entwickelt sich diese erst im Fortschreiten der Geschichte. 
Chiko und Issa (eiskalter Krimineller und emotioneller Freund und Vater)
Curly (ebenfalls eiskalter Krimineller und liebevoller Ehemann und Vater)
Tibet verwandelt sich von einem jungen Erwachsenen mit jugendlichen Träumen  zu einem gebrochenen Mörder seines Bruders/Freundes. Tibets Charakterliche Veränderung wird zwischenzeitlich durch das Rasieren seiner Haare gezeigt. Zu Beginn gibt es noch zwei Spiegelbilder, zum Ende der Rasur zeigen sich nur mehr ein ganzes und ein halbes Spiegelbild.

LeagueofLegendsMeta,1,0,1,"&gt;the core idea is a ""for fun"" one, even if the execution of the idea is serious.

By interpreting it this way you are making assumptions about the intentions of the poster which are prejudicial. Taken to an extreme it will end up with us drawing an arbitrary line around what is and isn't an acceptable topic based on a fuzzy standard of what's for winning and what's for fun. I don't find this position tenable so I think the justification to allow rogue posts like these shifts to the effort and substance of the post itself to justify it's own existence. 

Remember, it's not just about optimizing an off-build. It's about validating it within the context of the metagame and playing-to-win.

Eve,2,0,2,"This happened about a month ago but changed my experience in Eve forever.

I've always lived in high sec, running missions and doing exploration. I did this for years (not consistently, I subbed off and on). Eventually I got tired and moved to low sec. I started farming certain combat sites. I got a couple hundred mil every now and then... One day a BP dropped. It looked like some useless module but I looted it anyways. Looking it up on contracts got me to do a double take. 1.2b was the going price. Holy. Shit. I've never looted anything this valuable. Looking up the item on the market showed the module going for ~200M a piece. The bp had the potential to bring me 1.7b in profit. Fuck ya.

So I'm just about to leave when I see local spike with reds/yellows. Fuck it, I'm already about to warp off! But then... I realize I'm only 2AU from the gate and it's pretty fucking obvious where I'm at and within a few seconds about 6 ships jump on top of me. This is the first real PVP I've experienced. I was tackled and webbed.. fortunately they couldn't break my tank, said gf then left. I got back to the station and dropped my loot off and chased them down. Almost got a few of them but had no point. They bailed again and I chased. 

Long story short I found them again and they tackled me and lit a cyno for a carrier to jump in. I lost my ship but was still so fucking excited. I loved it. 

Not too long later I decided to move into a C4 with a new Corp that I absolutely love. Eve has never been better

Because they don't make over a million dollars a year in wages and salaries.   Not most of them.

Most of them make money in dividends and stock options. That's still taxed at a flat, what? 15%?

If I can find a copy of the program I'll post it here.

I wrote said script in python in about 2 minutes, including debugging, and never used it again. in this case, it doesn't matter weather it's a binary or java byte-code or whatever.

explainlikeimfive,-5,0,-5,"My human geography teacher stated that there are various probable reasons for the bulbs, or ""onion domes"", in Russia. One reason is that the color is a bit of a morale booster as Russia is usually cold all the time and gets less hours of sunlight. Another possibility is that the onion shape of the dome helps to ensure that too much snow doesn't collect on top of the building; if it were another shape the snow might get too heavy and cause structural damage. Finally, the onion domes are usually located on religious buildings (i.e. Russian Orthodox Churches), so the color and the tall size attracts attention and also describes the significance of the building. As for the Middle East, onion domes are also prominent on religious structures, in this case mosques, so it's likely that they are similarly symbolic of the importance of the structure. There does seem to be some sort of historical connection in which the same architectural style diffused to both the Middle East and to Russia, but after some research it appears that various historians are in disagreement about the origin of the style.",t3_37k26c,crnef0e,t3_37k26c,t1_crnef0e

PurplePillDebate,1,0,1,"Emotions won't be a perfect guide to reality--they won't necessarily tell you what to do in a situation. But they will give you data and information about situations and about yourself. What you do with it is up to you but a person who feels an emotion is not primed to be less rational in every case. A person who doesn't feel emotions would be someone who doesn't have access to some of the data our unconscious mind is processing for us. 

Letting your emotions drive your judgement would be very unwise--but trying not to feel your emotions is equally unwise. 

You wouldn't use an emotion in science but without excitement of discovery, curiosity, etc. many people would lack the motivation to do science. It's hard work--emotions are also motivators, rewards, information, etc.

The problem is in the use of the word ""equal"". Men and women are equally human beings, deserve equal human rights as a result, and have equal potential. 

However, due to biology and/or socialization, they make different choices that result in macroscopic differences between trends in the genders that are not present on the microscopic (individual) scales. A single woman going into psychology is not evidence of any differences in genders, nor is a single man going into engineering. But when 70% of psychology students are women, and when 80% of engineers are men, there becomes an issue.

baseball,4,0,4,"http://losangeles.angels.mlb.com/ana/ballpark/directions/index.jsp?content=parking

&gt;Day of game parking is $10.00 CASH ONLY and oversized vehicles (greater than 20 feet in length) are $20.00. The bus parking lot is located near the Orangewood Avenue entrance.

https://www.teammarketing.com/public/uploadedPDFs/2014+mlb+fci.pdf

MLB average parking price: $15.09

Angels, Royals and D-backs are $10. Brewers are $9. O's and Padres at $8. Twins have $6 parking. Rays win at $0, but that's because it takes a year to travel to their stadium and even fewer people would go if that had to pay for parking.

So yeah, not only am I fairly certain parking prices haven't been raised in many years, but even if they were raised to $10, they're still tied for 5th lowest in the MLB, and especially fair considering there's practically no public transport and everyone in Orange County has to use cars to get around. The Angels were top 5 in attendance last season and are sitting at #6 so far this season. So given those factors, the price of parking could definitely be higher, but I think everyone realizes it's not wise to rock that boat.

So in short, the Angels have the cheapest beer per ounce in the MLB, but parking costs aren't really the offset for that.",t3_37luqy,crnx3ge,t1_crnwj05,t1_crnx3ge

&gt; It is possible for gliders to interact with other objects in interesting ways. For example, if two gliders are shot at a block in just the right way, the block will move closer to the source of the gliders. If three gliders are shot in just the right way, the block will move farther away. This ""sliding block memory"" can be used to simulate a counter. It is possible to construct logic gates such as AND, OR and NOT using gliders. It is possible to build a pattern that acts like a finite state machine connected to two counters. This has the same computational power as a universal Turing machine, so the Game of Life is theoretically as powerful as any computer with unlimited memory and no time constraints: it is Turing complete.

dogecoin,1,0,1,"I always recommend the core wallet, the only downside is 11GB of disk space for the blockchain and the long sync time.  But if you have the space and don't mind waiting a day to sync, the core wallet has the most features, and by running it you are supporting the dogecoin network by running a node.  

Multidoge is good if you are impatient and if you don't get lots of transactions from faucets and mining.  It is quick to set up and your privkeys are 100% in your control.

Dogechain or block.io are by far the best online wallet solutions right now.  They are good for the convenience of access to your doge from any internet connected device.  But if the servers go down for whatever reason you've lost access.  I believe you can get your privkeys from dogechain though, but that wouldn't help in the event of a hiccup, you'd have to get them before.

tl;dr depends on what you want in terms of features/security/ease of use.  Core wallet is da bomb.

Whatever you get make sure to encrypt and back up

DebateAChristian,1,0,1,"&gt; Look I get what you are claiming, that the Genesis account is somehow metaphorical, and therfore the scientific accuracy of what is contained within it doesn't matter...

It's not that the scientific accuracy doesn't matter the point is that there is no scientific content in the creation narratives.  It doesn't make sense to say that the details are scientifically accurate or in inaccurate because the creation accounts in Genesis are not written in scientific terms.  Christians have been telling you this over and over in these threads but you're still insisting that there must be scientific content in early Genesis.  Why? 

&gt;Just out of interest, if you do believe that Genesis is merely metaphorical then what is God really trying to imply?

I get the impression from your language that you think metaphor is a lesser form of truth.  As if metaphor must be converted into some material form to be meaningful.  I don't think that way at all.  
I believe the creation accounts tell us about the nature of God and of creation and our relationship with God and creation.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly

Go ahead and read the section on the differences between monopoly and competition. Here's a good excerpt:

 ""The fact that a monopoly has a downward-sloping demand curve means that the relationship between total revenue and output for a monopoly is much different than that of competitive companies.[27] Total revenue equals price times quantity. A competitive company has a perfectly elastic demand curve meaning that total revenue is proportional to output.[27] Thus the total revenue curve for a competitive company is a ray with a slope equal to the market price.""

Do you not think, then, that our systemic exploitation of animals *is* immoral? Since it is driven by desire for meat (I'm leaving out discussion of pets here) rather than a *need* for food? Plant-based diets have been shown to be significantly better for the environment, for instance. In this case surely the logical thing to do would be to suffer the absence of meat?

Since it is entirely possible, and in many ways beneficial, to have a vegetarian/vegan diet, are we not needlessly causing suffering to animals and thereby de-humanising ourselves?

This is just a series of conflations on your part. Yes, jews lived there (I never denied this) but they were such a small amount of the population and then suddenly owned 70% of the land.

His ability to run with the ball is phenomenal at his best. 

Chris Smalling having the most shots inside the 6 yard box is hilarious. I predict people will use that as an stick to beat our strikers with, but in Van Gaals system the forward is a space creator/disruptor as much as a poacher.

AR10,2,0,2,"Thanks for taking the time EinGuy

1) Yup

2) I was having major cycling issues and I ended up replacing the BCG and the gas block. Before I made those changes I shot two types of ammo and I was getting much deeper and much more pronounced case head swipes on both. I'd imagine that even though I was getting ejection issues and short stroking the system was over gassed. Same is probably the case now.

3) The scratching is pretty consistent. Happens to all cases. Some are deeper and more pronounced. Some are barely visible marks, but all have a scratch.

4) My carbine length AR15 dents case mouths just like it's big brother. The AR15 has been exceptionally reliable, so I figured the dents weren't an issue. 

5) The rifle is way too heavy to hunt with. It'll be a bench gun for shooting at targets. It'll almost be exclusively fed with FMJ.

6) The extractor grove looks ok. It's not mangled, but if I run my finger across it I can feel burs and scratches.

7) Seeing as the bolt wasn't locking back I was trying to increase the amount of gas that the system was getting. In retrospect it might be a good idea to dial it down and see what happens.

8) I've only tested one mag. Before changing out the parts I had issues with two mags.

Now that you keep mentioning the magazines I did notice that the back of the follower has a big dent in it. [Here is a picture](http://i.imgur.com/qvm8hpU.jpg). I guess that would mean that one of the stripping lugs is a bit too low and drags on the top most round.

hiphopheads,421,0,421,"I was reading an interview with some of the female artists that collaborated on this record, and one of them said something really interesting that I thought was true, that the connecting thread that ties this album together is the instrumentation of Donnie Trumpet (and not the lyricism and rapping of Chance and co). That seems obvious since this is a Donnie project, but I think we really need to distinguish this from Chance. Obviously he's on a lot of these songs, but he feels like just another instrument to me that's being conducted by Nico. 

Putting aside the philosophy behind this piece, I thought the production on this was really beautiful and well-rounded. It's a little disjointed and jarring on one listen through, each piece exists in it's own small world, but after having heard a lot of albums in the past few years where every song flows seamlessly into another song, it was nice to get a really different vibe from different songs. There's so many different textures and small details placed behind these songs, it feels really rich and jazz-baroque (if that's a thing, I don't know). That makes it all the stranger why it feels like this hasn't been mixed that well. I'm not a producer, I don't know any of the technical stuff but there's a lot of times that I'll be listening to a song on here and I'm hearing fuzziness. I'm assuming they didn't intend that effect, or maybe it's cause I downloaded a shady copy and not the official iTunes version. Regardless, the production is stellar. It really reminds me of early Beatles/Beach Boys, it had all the infectious happiness of something like Smile! or Help!

I'm so glad they didn't display the features and let us figure them out, hearing Busta's laugh on Slip Slide for the first time with no warning was one of my favourite moments of listening to this album. I thought they'd gotten a Kendrick feature for a second when I heard Cole's verse and I got kinda bummed when I realized, but I still thought J did a really good job. None of the other features really stood out prominently for me, but I thought they were all pretty good and fit the mood of each song.

Overall, this is a really good album that I'm going to be coming back to all summer. I still think Acid Rap is better than this but this is a solid 8 for me. 2/10 album art though.",t3_37szvo,crpmjie,t3_37szvo,t1_crpmjie

leagueoflegends,3,0,3,"The items sound great in theory, but you need to ask yourself what you sacrifice to gain said items.

The reason for this has to simply deal with the allocation of gold. While some items due to other reasons may look attractive, it's important to consider the gains generated by other items achievable earlier on with *different* bonuses due to the fact that said items generally carry a greater item budget.

Sure, you could build a Trinity Force and Black Cleaver, but you could also say build a Black Cleaver Infinity Edge (as an example) where you will universally benefit from both the end-achievements of completing the items, but you will also benefit from the universal components that would build into the IE because instead of building say a phage with a ruby/Longsword you have a BF/pickaxe which results in a greater powerspike.

Not only that, but lategame given only 6 total items, you're only going to be limiting your champion's potential when it comes to damage/survivability output due to unique passives.

The party isn't why I'm nexting her. We've broke up before, I shouldn't have got back with her, she wants me for marriage/kids and I've made it clear from day 1 I'm not open for either. There's been some behavior I won't deal with and really I don't have a good time with her anymore. And it's not fair to her for me to drag it out either.

The reality is that she's been a net-loss for me career/development wise, and I really need to focus on that aspect of my life. I got complacent, and I need to let her know asap so she's not wasting her time.

welp. Someone either didn't read or is so incredibly stubborn in their viewpoint that they can't even bother to actually think about it. Have a broader scope for discussion, please. x.x

For the record i dont actually think ""dumb"" people should just be taken away the right to have kids. I do however believe that people are incredibly irresponsible with how they raise kids and teach morals. Parent's who are shitty people and teach their kids how to be shitty people shouldn't deserve to raise a kid or be responsible for a child's well being/life. Making mistakes is a part of life...if a good person makes a mistake thats one thing. If a couple accidentally has a child and is put into that situation thats one thing...but a girl in highschool who has a kid at 16...and can't be responsible enough not to get pregnant *again* two more times before she's 20 isn't really someone i'd consider responsible or mature enough to handle that kind of thing.

AskReddit,1886,0,1886,"The Pokemon War theory.

It really only applies to the first series, but there are no adult males at or near middle ages except for scientists, naval officers, and criminals. The only reasonably aged male is Lt. Surge, and what would he be a lieutenant of?

Ash's father died in the war, that's why his mother is so concerned, but willing to let Ash go. He's just like his father and he loved Pokemon. 

Jenny and Joy are the result of cloning that was needed to fill necessary positions when people go off to war. There are tons of leftover nurses so they give free health care, at least to Pokemon. Jenny was filling in since most of the police force had to go fight. 

There's more but I can't remember it. 

Clarification edit: this is based on the anime so I may have been overstepping with the naval officers, I don't remember if they were in the show. Also explains why Brocks father is afraid to come back (black joke usually goes here, but he actually abandoned his post/duty) and why Misty and her sisters run the gym.

He is shown eating a sandwich with the crust on it early in the first season.  When he and Jesse kidnap that drug dealer and bike-lock him in the basement Walt makes him a sandwich and the dealer asks Walt to cut the crusts off.  After Walt eventually kills him, whenever Walt is shown making a sandwich he cuts the crust off.

Not convinced?

When Jane dies, Walt has a scotch with her father.  I don't think he knows who he is talking to, but he orders his scotch neat.  Mike takes his scotch on the rocks, and after Walt kills him so does he.

Still?  Ok.  One more.

Gus.  When Walt kills Gus, he cements into Gus' role and demenor.  He starts doing some pretty brutal shit with Gus' trademark stoicism.

cars,41,0,41,"Do people really consider the new M4 a work of art?  I mean don't get me wrong, I think its a handsome car, and I like it more than the last gen, but I don't know, there is something too practical about the way it looks.  Maybe that's just my bias, but I usually find that the Germans are more focused with making a machine than a piece of art, not that something can't be both.

There are some obvious [exceptions](http://supercar.website/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Porsche-911-GT3-RS-6.jpg), but all to often I feel like the Germans restrain themselves.  They have to build the 3/4 series as a car that everyone can buy and drive, even if they hate cars in general, and that shapes the styling to be non polarizing, which in turn leads it to be less provocative than something like a 911.  And that attempt to avoid polarization and the end result of reduced emotion makes it seem like the opposite of most art, which fundamentally tries to stir your emotion.

Something like an Aventador, Viper, even a GT350, they try to move you emotionally with the way they look, and that means some people hate they way they look, and they are often less practical.

I think BMW set out to make the best 2 door coupe they could, the best driving machine they could make.  And of course they made it handsome, and of course the way it drives will cause people to develop a bond with it, and of course it has personality.  

I don't know, it's not stylized enough for me to consider it art.  It looks like someone built a very fast, very attractive coupe, but at the same time didn't want to offend anyone or be too gaudy.  

But then again we all have different definitions of art!",t3_37zeqr,crr56pq,t1_crr2vjz,t1_crr56pq
